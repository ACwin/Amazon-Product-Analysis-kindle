0,B07TMJ1R3X,"[1852, 1852]",5,"Right up front I want to address the negative reviews that tarnish this product because, as usual, people buy this at a very budget price and expect an iPad or Samsung Tablet. It is NOT an iPad or Samsung, it is an Amazon content delivery device. It is inexpensive because Amazon provides the content and they want you to have a cheap way to enjoy it. It is an E Reader, Music Player, Video Player not a full fledged Android Tablet. Like most Amazon devices it has ads on the lock screen. Any other ads are the fault of the apps. It can be massaged to load apps from Google Play but it wasn't designed for that and results will vary. Expecting this to perform like an iPad or Samsung is wishful thinking of the highest degree. If you can't afford an iPad, don't blame this unit. Don't buy it to do anything but read, listen and watch. I've worn out several of the Fire units over the years and I loved them. They are electronic devices and as such are likely to fail at some point. It's reality. I own 2 iPads as well as This Kindle, an old fire (USB port finally died) and a Kindle Paperwhite. They all serve a purpose. I read constantly and sometimes the Paperwhite is right, Sometimes the Fire is right. The iPads are PC replacements for me and do everything I need to run a small business and record music. I don't expect any of the Kindles to be iPads. Warranty is commensurate with value. 90 days is enough to verify operation. After 90 days you're just unlucky or you dropped the unit so many times it gave up. iPads have a 1 year warranty and you pay for it. My last iPad cost me over $500. I expect a lot more from it than I do a Kindle. I apologize for ranting but it sucks that good products suffer because of bad expectations. A Kindle Fire is a great device for what it was intended to do. I don't really like backlit screens for reading, but sometimes they're desirable. I can watch Movies, Listen to Audiobooks, Listen to music, Stream content and read books and magazines. All on one device that has a screen I don't have to squint at to enjoy. All for a very reasonable price. I had some A-hole grab my fire and run while I was getting a drink refill and it wasn't a nightmare... like if he had run off with my iPad. Buy this for what it is, don't complain about what it isn't.","06 30, 2020",R3QL2UQWTSMS7J,Amazon Customer,"It's a Kindle, with a color screen.",1593446400

I enjoy reading books and watching videos on my new Kindle.

- Screen and Size:
I appreciate the form factors -- it has sufficient screen size for my use but also very portable to carry around. The display quality of the 8 inch screen is great, everything is crisp and sharp. For me it is the most important thing. It's a great content consumption device which provides excellent reading experience similar to my old Paperwhite.

- Speed
The marketing material says 30%. Honestly it doesn't matter for my use.
It is smooth enough for web browsing.

- Battery Life:
It claims up to 12 hours of battery life, which impressive for tablet this size.
Based on my initial impression, it is probably true.I will come back to update this review later about my real-world usage.

- Charging
Type-C port! No more micro-USB!
According to the specifications, charging time is 5 hours.
Get a more powerful charger and I think this regular HD 8 will charge up just as fast as the more expensive Fire HD 8 Plus, if not faster!
In my video review, I used a type-c PD charger that delivers 14.12 watts of power when the tablet is around 68% battery. With the included charger, it was only able to deliver 5 watts. I won‚Äôt be surprised it can be charged from 0 to 100% under 3 hours!

- Storage:
It supports 1TB of additional storage! I I bought the 32GB version, put in 64GB SD card and plan to get a larger one in the future for movie storage.

- Capable of enabling Alexa, with on/off toggle.
It works but I don't use Alexa much.","06 10, 2020",R3EMO2UBJ0J2VL,Tools. Electro. DIY Tools. Electro. DIY,"Great tablet (Amazon, why was my first review removed?)",1591718400

Whenever it‚Äôs turned on every few seconds the screen will go black and then turn back on. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on the home screen or in an app. My son tried to use this kindle many times during ‚Äúhomeschooling‚Ä?and it would not work. Because of COVID it took me awhile to get to costumer service as this problem has been going for a few months. Once I was able to talk with someone they told me that because it was purchased through Target they are not responsible for replacing it. This doesn‚Äôt make since to me as it‚Äôs an amazon product.
Years ago I had a problem with my iPad. I contacted Apple not the store that I purchased it from (which was also Target). They spent time on the phone with me and tried to fix my device. When they couldn‚Äôt they sent me a new device since the iPad wasn‚Äôt even a year old.
I guess you get what you pay for and I payed for junk and received crap costumer service. I know we‚Äôre I‚Äôll be purchasing my kids next device from. I would give this Kindle 0 stars and Costumer Service a 0 rating as well for not even trying to trouble shot the problem. I wonder if I call Target if they have techs to help determine the problem. I doubt it since it‚Äôs an Amazon product.","06 03, 2020",R3HPDZBVAQZZ5R,Kerri Hanse,Bad Costumer Service for a broken Kindle,1591113600
3,B07TMJ1R3X,"[1256, 1256]",5,"First of all, this isn‚Äôt an iPad, not even in competition with one so don‚Äôt compare it to that. I view the fire tablet line to be solely for media consumption in which they excel at. They‚Äôre a great starter tablet for younger kids and teens because of the price and durability.

Packaging was simple with minimal plastic. Setup took a few seconds with an available amazon account.

The tablet itself is light and portable. The screen looks good and the sound comes out fine although not as loud as I would like. The volume is better when using headphones. Bluetooth pairing is also really quick and reliable.

I use this tablet mainly for reading kindle books and magazines and browsing the amazon app. I also watch Netflix and Hulu and YouTube with ease.

I couldn‚Äôt care less about google play store because I was able to download all the apps I frequently use on the device for free. I do know that you can add google play store if you so desired so there‚Äôs no problem there.

I don‚Äôt use the tablet to game so I can‚Äôt speak on that aspect but overall, as a budget tablet I like using the fire hd 8 a lot when I need to go out and don‚Äôt want to lug around my heavier and more expensive iPad.

I don‚Äôt care for the camera on this tablet but it‚Äôs not bad in its own right. The camera on this tablet is mediocre but gets the job done and your expectations for it shouldn‚Äôt be that high to begin with in all honesty. A better camera will drive up the price and just how often do you actually use it should be a question you genuinely ask yourself before you start docking stars for the camera.

This is a great little device for media consumption if you want a bigger screen to work with than your regular-degular smart phone. HIGHLY recommend for media consumption and kindle reading. Super affordable, comfortable to hold thanks to the larger uniform bezels and portable for on the go usage. Battery life is also great considering the brightness levels I keep it at and charged via USB TYPE C which is a bonus.","06 15, 2020",RYP6LE0E6NVZG,seRAEtonin seRAEtonin,Love it!,1592150400
4,B07TMJ1R3X,"[656, 656]",1,"I bought this tablet thinking it would be an improvement over older models. Yes it's a bit faster than the previous model, but still frustratingly slow when compared to current generation tablets from competitors.

Yes this runs on Android, but the user interface is totally modified by Amazon, and you cannot remove/hide apps, screens that you don't use. For example, ""Books"", ""Newsstand"", ""Audible"", and ""Music"" are all areas I don't use, but there's no way to hide these screens. They just clutter space on my screen, and makes using the tablet more frustrating.

Also, you cannot install Google Chrome. Instead, you need to use Amazon's web browser, ""Silk"", which I'm not familiar with, and would much rather not have to use a totally separate browser for this tablet, when i use Chrome on all other devices I have.

I have side loaded a few apps as I intend to install the Google Play Store and Services at a later date. But so far I have not run into any performance related issues. The reason for the 3 star review is because of their scummy mobile app monetization with their special offers. Now I knew full well going into my purchase what the deal was but I don't understand why I should have to pay an additional $20-30 to have ads removed when everything else about the tablet is the same from a hardware perspective. Its like when you download a free-to-play game or app but then you can pay to remove ads except the game itself is still free. The difference being that usually buying the paid version of an app is I would say maybe $10 or so generally. And also often times paying for an app also gives you access to additional features. But in this case we have to pay $20-30 to remove the annoying lock screen ads and get nothing extra for that payment. Now I may sound stupid complaining about a potentially trivial matter for most people but its just annoying to me and I don't think its a good business practice.

Video freezes repeatedly while sound continues . What a piece of crap this 2020 HD8 release is. I'm not waiting to see what else is wrong, this is going back.

I have had the last 3 Kindle Fire versions which were all wonderful. Amazon has really screwed up this time.

Since I posted this review someone from Amazon Customer Service called me on my personal phone to discuss my review
WTF ? Where did they even get the number?? Not Acceptable At All !!!! I think they might be trying to remove bad reviews.

Update: the replacement arrived. It also freezes up video while audio continues when playing Prime Video. See the video I sent. Second one is going back, Customer Product Support could not fix 7/16/2020.

Update - I received my 3rd one yesterday, replaced twice.Amazon Video freezes up after a few minutes every time. I installed Netflix and it plays video fine. My 2 other Fires and 2 fire sticks stream video fine.

Only my purchases Amazon digital content and Prime Video content freezes up. I have spent over two hours total so far trying to get support with this single, identifiable issue. I DO NOT NEED to restart my router, Amazon.

They won't let me post multiple videos of the freeze ups here. Hmmmm.

The battery life is outstanding and the screen quality, while not the greatest, is still perfectly adequate. I don‚Äôt see any pixelization. It‚Äôs fine for the price.

I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt see this mentioned anywhere, reading many reviews, but the surround sound effects are outstanding! This is a five-star feature on such an inexpensive device. You‚Äôll hear things that you wouldn‚Äôt notice on headphones. It‚Äôs very much like a 2.1 surround sound stereo system.

Even for full price it‚Äôs hella deal for a media player with huge battery life. It‚Äôs solidly built and seems like it would handle small drops but I got a case just to be safe. It also works fine with streaming music apps, and sounds good, but volume output to the speakers is not powerful. Plenty loud with headphones but speaker volume is 3-star rating at best, being small, and not unlike other tablets.

You don‚Äôt need to be a tech geek to install the Google Play Store to get whatever apps the Amazon App Store does t have. There are many tutorials on line. It‚Äôs simply four files to download and install (in a specific order). It‚Äôs easy and works great, adding a little more ‚Äúreal Android tablet‚Ä?functionality. That‚Äôs just a bonus. This thing is meant for video viewing and works great for that without anything extra.

Overall, it‚Äôs a sometimes laggy inexpensive media player with impressive sound quality, if perhaps not as loud as you‚Äôd like it to be on the external speakers, great battery life, pretty good screen, and good mobile game rendering. Of course, the Kindle reader works great and you can easily do your email and social media stuff. With some of the missing pieces out of the Google Play Store, it‚Äôs a pretty good Android tablet‚Äîespecially if you can pick it up on sale. I think it‚Äôs a solid four-star product. Not perfect but pretty darn good if you keep to its main purpose as a media player.

Finally, as you can see from the attached screenshot, it does function perfectly well as an Android tablet. After you've loaded the Google Play store, download the free Nova Launcher app. This allows you to arrange the screen with apps and widgets however you want.

This tablet is horrendous garbage, just like the last one I had. Why do I keep doing this to myself? The price isn't even good enough to justify it based on that anymore.

I hate this object. First of all, ads. They can't even sell this product at a high enough price point to cover its manufacturing costs so they subsidize the cost of that with ads. How immoral is that? What does it say about not just the quality of item you are receiving, but the treatment given to the workers who make these? Do any of us believe for a SECOND they are paid fairly or given all the needed safety measures to do their jobs? How can they be if this item is not even capable of turning a profit (or breaking even) without advertising? So that's, yes, immoral.

The second bout of related immorality is how aggressively these tablets are marketed to parents of SMALL children. A direct advertising pipeline into not even formed yet brains. A KNOWN TO BE DAMAGING electronic babysitter with a new, even more insidious, consumerist twist.

What really drives home the disgustingness of it all is what terrible products these are at the end of the day. I thought upgrading two steps up in versions would make a difference in quality. Even just how better tech becomes available and cheaper every year. Not so with the Kindle fire. The camera is still potato quality. Basically insulting to keep devoting space to it at this point, it's so embarrassing.

The newly improved memory and such means nothing. Games still crash for no reason. It's sluggish. The web browser makes Microsoft's modern attempts adown right browsers look downright award worthy.

I'm leaving that last insane sentence I just wrote intact. Im writing this on my device right now. The typing and spellcheck on it are atrocious. It splits and butchers words, has an EXTREMELY limited word bank, it adds corrected words INTO the misspelled word when you try to correct. On and on. It is the worst user experience possible. Like trying to write a novel on an old Nokia, because EVERY word takes so much effort for the stupid thing to spit out. It can't keep up with my typing and I use ONE FINGER.

I replaced my old Fire because it had planned obsolescence. It stopped recognizing my memory card for no reason one day, and with that, it refused to load my books. It wouldn't open anything. It couldn't support the games it only used to kind of handle in the first place. It bricked itself. And now I find the new version is exactly the same. Same awful camera, same intrusive ads everywhere (Which books are mine and which are just being advertised in the exact same format- no one knows!), same sluggish response times, same poorly designered userinterfaces, and same exact look, feel, design, everything else. The memory isn't an improvement as it's kind of like inflation. Over time, you need more to do the same things you could before as games and apps become more sophisticated, collections grow, new things become accessible on more platforms, etc. (You'd think it would be the opposote, but designers design to the limits of their technology.) So just keeping up with that basic need shouldn't be touted as a feature.

So this is the last Fire I will ever buy. There is clearly no intention here to innovate or even just keep up! This product is permanently stuck in 2007. I don't need novelty or change for changes sake. The problems, weaknesses, and outright failures of this device are so readily apparent it NEEDS to change. But apparently, that's not on the menu. Just the same item, year after year, a new number slapped on it, existing only to replace the last one that died just as planned. So really, garbage. Landfill fodder. In the most literal sense, that is what you are buying here.

It's not worth it. Buy literally anything else.

(Bonus complaint: ebooks are in no way cheaper than regular paper books anymore. The golden age of SANITY is gone. You will pay the same price now for a paper book that you would for one that DOESN'T need deforestation and undervalued human labor to produce, fossil fuels to deliver, and even more of both to haul around with yoh for the rest of your life. (""Yoh"" is a really good autocorrect for ""you""! Wow Kindle, yohre doing such a great job typing! No joke, it really did follow that up by suggesting ""yohre"" for the next sentence. Trash.) In fact, I've found many modern books and bestsellers actually charging MORE for the ebook version. That is evil. I'm not speaking facetiously, I really do believe that is morally wrong. Can't spare one drop of profit to reduce the environmental impact of this class of items. EVIL.)","10 04, 2020",R216STKBRK0CWM,Basil Abraxas,Literal Garbage,1601740800

However, it's not quite ready for release. Just getting it set up with her apps and things I've already had it lock up on me twice and required a reboot, it's generally just as sluggish in the UI as the older tablet, and it's BUGGY. I have been on with support (if you really want to call them that) for over an hour (Edit, ended up at 2.5 hours before I gave up) trying to figure out why apps can't access the camera/microphone in my child's FreeTime profile.

The wifi is also horrible - I am 30' from an Orbi router with 3 other devices that have full wifi and this thing has 1 bar...1. It took FOREVER for it to download apps on our Gigabit internet.

I'd hold off on this one and see if they work out the kinks....I know I am not buying replacements for my other kids at this point in time, even if their old version breaks.

**UPDATE and adding a couple stars from 1 to 3** Amazon reached out to me today and is aware of the issues with FreeTime and permissions and is working on it as well as the overall service experience. The tablet hasn‚Äôt locked up since the initial setup either, so I‚Äôm going to remain hopeful that it‚Äôll get there.

I also have an HD 10 2019 with the 2GB ram and the nicer screen. That thing does well. It does some some slowdown on Hearthstone and some other stuff. But snappier than the HD 8s are.

So, I see this plus model with 3 GB ram. That extra GB should make a difference. And given that the tablet still runs the lower res. screen compared to the 10 I have I gave it a go. Sure enough, unlike on the others I have had not hanging and freezing on Hearthstone or any of the other games. I have had no noticeable lag. Is it as fast as my LG G8X or my iPad. No, but I get no slowdown. For the price it is great, IMO.

I do have the 2018 fire 8 so have something to compare. Anyway, after doing all the settings and getting down to reading i see that at the bottom of the screen there is under the glass a stain. I would look as if a very diluted lemon juice was spilled and smadged. Its faint, but it is very disturbing to read. On top of that, it looks like that faded light cream color is seen all around the white page when in reading mode. Looks as if its a bit unclean. Almost like a paper was left in the sun and the edges faded to cream color. I tried changing the background color but i dont like it.
Hopefully with time i will get used to it and will ignore it. Quite a dissapointment. The 2018 seems just a bit better overall.
8.21.2020 after two months of using TWO new tablets i come across a new issue: lately when i buy a few (5-7) books on kindle unlimited and i go to the kindle app on each of the new tablets, the app opens but does not show the list of my books, it jumps back to the home screen. It happens on both tablets. I try to press the download feature quick to avoid the jump back but it doesnt help. It goes back to home page. I try othr things but to no avail. It alway jumps back to home page.
This tablet has a problem thats for sure, a problem with software!!!!!

I have TWO new tablets and i cannot get into my library. It is the only reason i bought these tablets, for reading. Im so angry.!!!

I just got my second new fire 8 tablet. Comparing it with the one i bought 2 months ago i can see one big difference. The tablet's screen brightness is not the same. In the new one the light is more faded, less bright. A bit like old paper. Both are on full battery and full brightness. Not very happy to see such a difference between two new tablets of the same model.
Shame on the manufacturing.","06 18, 2020",R14T4GZUO9RS0L,Simcha,"Plenty of issues, screen, software etc.",1592409600
25,B07TMJ1R3X,"[43, 43]",3,"Update-I have had the tablet for about 4 months and starting to have issues. After some use the tablet becomes almost totally non responsive. Rebooting solves the problem. Strange that it would develop this issue on its own. Just reminds me that while this is a decent tablet, it is frequently on sale for less than $75 and you shouldn't expect much out of it.

I've had 2 Fire 7's in the past. Both were so slow they were unusable even for the most basic task. I have an iPad that I really like but wanted a cheap tablet that I would not care much if it got lost or damaged to take to appointments, travel, etc. All I wanted to use it for is to read books from places other than Amazon, read news, play music, etc. This tablet has usable speed and slightly better screen quality and serves my need. At the sale price I am not concerned if I lose or damage it. During the short period of time that I have had the device, battery life has been exceptional, especially compared to the Fire 7 that I had previously.

During the setup you will be pushed to buy additional services through free trials. Just remember to cancel if you accept any of the trials. The build quality is quite good. The placement of the power switch right next to volume is terrible. Be sure to go through your privacy settings after setup to turn off access to microphone, contacts, location, etc that don't really need it. You can also opt out of personalized ads which limits the ability to track you a little. Turning off notifications will help with the battery life and may help with device responsiveness.

The Amazon customization makes the tablet screens look very busy, but do give easy access to anything you want from Amazon. You can pay extra to limit ads, but that only turnoff the ad when the device boots up, does to eliminate or customize the ads you see elsewhere. You have to remember that Amazon sells tablets at this price to get you to but other Amazon products. Disappointing that the O/S is based on a old version of Android that has security issues. Not sure if Amazon has done anything remediate this, but I don't keep any important data on the device. You can encrypt the device but I can find nothing that talks to the level of encryption and the device specs are so low that it can't really support the power needs to decrypt any data.

You can get 32 or 64 GB of storage. Since it supports micro usb, go with the smaller. This is still enough to support the O/S and apps that do not operate from the SD card. The O/S on my old Fire 7 grew quickly with upgrades. It appeared that some of the updates were just adding data. I had to reset to original specs a couple of times so there was any space left. Hope this will not do that, but if it does the 32 GB will allow me to postpone that as much as possible.

Sound level is quite good even if the quality is average at best. The speakers are both on the ""top"" which makes it great if you are watching a video.

The device only has 2 GB of ram, which is a huge improvement of the 1 GB on the 7. Unlike with an iPad that knows to put unused apps to sleep, this device keeps them open and using RAM. You must close apps when not using to keep performance at a decent level.

The tablet does not have GPS like more expensive tablet but depends on ""WIFI tracking"" for location. This will be ok in town, but of little use where there are few other WIFI points.

The camera is barely OK. It works to take a pic to remember something, but not anything you would ever want to view on a larger screen or print out. It low light it‚Äôs basically worthless.

It is possible to install the Google store and have access to the apps that are not available on the Amazon store. It is not a very complicated process but you do need to follow the instructions exactly.

With all of its faults, based on what you are paying (especially if you get it on sale) Amazon finally has a Tablet that is usable. It get 4 stars based on what it delivers for the price, not compared to more expensive tablets that deliver a lot more. The 90 day warranty is pretty bad.

28,B07TMJ1R3X,"[31, 31]",3,"The Fire HD 8 is (was) my third Fire tablet. I returned it today, primarily because of software issues. IMHO I think Amazon released the latest generation of Fire tablets too soon. The more I used the new Fire HD 8, the more I felt like I was using beta software.
First the good stuff: the new CPU and 10th gen hardware really speeds things up. The power up is many, many times faster than my older Fire HD 7 (4th gen). Same with power down but not quite so noticeable. The faster processor is a boon everywhere. The battery life is OUTSTANDING! When I‚Äôm reading a lot, I need to recharge the HD7 about every other day. I used the HD8 a week or more before recharging.
Now the bad stuff, starting with a few nits: (1) The AC/DC power adapter is a bit under powered @ 5W. It gets really hot when recharging the HD8‚Äôs battery. The adapter should be at least 10W. I switched to a 15W adapter and had no problems with heat. (2) There is no ‚ÄúLow Battery‚Ä?alert. The HD7 gives a notification when the battery level reaches 20%. (3) There is an annoying beep when the HD8 is powered up. (This seems to have the same function as the POST (Power On Self Test) beep found on PCs. Anyway, the beep can't be turned off nor can the volume be changed. (The dog goes crazy!)
Nits (2) and (3) might be resolved in the software. More obvious software issues can be seen in the accompanying pix. BTW the photos were taken with the HD7 and HD8 side-by-side, with both devices connected to Wi-Fi. (4) The HD8‚Äôs notification icons are just plain white squares and/or circles. The HD7 has graphical icons that we‚Äôre all familiar with. (5) Along the same thread, notice that the shipping icons shown on the HD7 are completely absent from the HD8. Since Amazon sends notifications to all devices associated with a user‚Äôs account, there is definitely something missing in the HD8‚Äôs software.
And now THE reason for me returning the HD8: (6) The standard keyboard options are NOT available in the Kindle Reader app. This specifically shows up when writing notes. (I called the Fire tablet technical support group, and this deficiency in the Kindle Reader app was confirmed.) Not having the ""Next Word Prediction(HD7)/Suggestions(HD8)"" is a deal breaker for me because I write a lot of notes when reading an ebook. Without these options the number of keystrokes while writing notes increases by a factor of 5-to-10 times. That starts to get very tedious! And I‚Äôm reading a lot of ebooks now‚Ä?Finally, whether it‚Äôs a hardware issue or a software issue, the display ‚Äúauto dimming‚Ä?feature does NOT work! I tried this out one night while reading in bed. Several minutes after enabling this feature, I started noticing changes in the display‚Äôs brightness. At one point I had the Settings window open, and with no physical contact with the HD8, I saw the brightness slider moving back and forth! Absolutely crazy!!
I do hope Amazon gets the kinks worked out because the increased performance in the 10th gen Fire tablet makes it quite appealing.","07 24, 2020",R18B7JHHHG4SBY,Van Zandt Van Zandt,An Unusual Disappointment,1595520000

So far, half of the games we want to download are NOT available. YouTube, Maps, Peggle Blast, Clash Royale, Google Docs, etc... NOT AVAILABLE.

However, for $44... This is an excellent tablet for Disney+, Netflix, and other Amazon-supported apps. It will suffice as a tablet for kids under 6 - but would not be enough for grade school age, and definitely not for middle school or older UNLESS all they want is Amazon reading, and movies.

Again, NO YouTube or Google apps is a major drawback. I get that they're trying to exclude their competition - but it comes as a huge detriment. Also, because their app store is smaller I'm sure THOUSANDS of popular Apps & Games are not available.

Some of the problems, however, make it almost useless if you plan to use the tablet with Audible. If you don't care about Audible, it's a good upgrade.

The problem with Audible is that it takes FOREVER to download a book. At about 10MB/min a book can take 30 minutes in the low fidelity mode. The problem is you have to keep messing with the screen, otherwise it goes to sleep, kills the download, and you have to start all over again. Some of that can be mitigated by changing the screen sleep to 30 minutes, but there are plenty of books that won't download in 30 minutes.

This problem exits on two different HD 8's on two different accounts. This problem doesn't exist on any other device connected to the same Wi-Fi access point. The only way I have found to fix the problem is to reset to factory defaults, sign in again to your Amazon/Audible account then immediately download everything you want to listen to. They will download nice and fast. When you quit using the tablet, it will automatically ""upgrade"" Audible to the new, fancy version of the app (which you cannot downgrade or uninstall independently) and you're back to the slow downloads.

For reasons I don't understand, the Audible app works the worse on the Fire devices. It has been problematic for years through various updates and on different versions of the Fire tablet. By contrast, Audible works just fine on my iOS devices through Echo, or via the web browser. So if you're planning on using this table with Audible, look somewhere else.

I would normally rate this tablet at 4-5 stars. It's not an iPad but then again it doesn't have the iPad price. But a key built-in feature is just plain broken and broken so badly that it hints at poor testing and software development. For that reason, I give it a one.

I'll check back should the situation improve. I've had messages going back and forth about this problem over the last month, so I am actively trying to find a resolution. But so far the responses have been formularic and have not helped. Maybe this review will get some attention applied to the Audible problem once and for all.

This was an impulse purchase when I saw the sale plus 20% off for a trade in. I'm trading in the 2015 7 inch, which was the worst Fire I've used. The 2012 8.9 was the best, too bad Amazon doesn't do beautiful screens like that anymore. More recently I also had the 2017 8 inch. The photo shows how much wider and shorter the 2020 is next to the 2017.

The 2020 screen is a little better than the older one, but the same low dpi (1080 x 800) which is very noticeable when web browsing. Speed seems pretty good for what I'm doing with it, mostly Prime Video and Kindle books. The Android Pie based OS is mostly the same as the 2015/2017 versions with a few tweaks. Besides the Amazon apps, I loaded the Google Play store to get the other apps I'll occasionally use. Look for the fire toolbox to easily add Google.

Until this last week, I rated the all new 2020 Fire 8 a solid 3-star device. It was OK, but inferior in every way to the gen 1, 7"" HDX except possibly for the sound.

I use the fire tablets almost exclusively for searching the web and reading books. My rating of a solid 3 stars gave way to a negative 5 this week when the internet on the fire 8 began to freeze. I would open tabs, but then could not close the open ones and could not open new tabs. The only way to stop the freeze was to shut down and reboot. I tried to empty my search history, etc., but it would not even do that. Every time I pushed the clear button it pitched me back to a list of visited sites that I could not delete. This tablet is inexpensive for a reason: it doesn't work very well.

So, no, I absolutely do not recommend this ""all new"" 2020 fire 8 tablet. Nor can I recommend the Amazon ""tech"" support people. I spent close to two hours on the phone with them today and all they did was make things worse.

After talking to a clueless amazon ""tech"" support person and pushing all the buttons she could think to push, she said the only solution was to deregister. Which I did. This, of course, made everything worse.

2,B07TMJ1R3X,"[12, 12]",4,"If this is your first Kindle, 5 stars across the board.

This is my second Fire HD 8, and my 5th Kindle overall. So this review is based on comparisons to my other Kindles. My previous Fire HD 8 (6th generation) began to have issues- the battery didn't last, the power cord connection had become loose, the screen had scratches and a small crack, silk pages didn't load as quickly (or completely) as when new, and apps didn't work consistently-- so I ordered a new one as a replacement.

This new 10th generation tablet has the following CONS, after having used the 6th generation for a few years:
- The charging cable is now a USB-C, so the 20+ charging and data usb cables I already have don't work with this one (MAJOR CON). Now I have to purchase several new cables to charge this Kindle with my existing charging station setup.

- The swipe-down quick access functions are fewer and show only an icon, which I had no idea what they are. Previous generations had them labeled. However, if you swipe down a second time to bring up quick access, or you swipe down one time on the default Special Offers page (the one you swipe bottom-to-top to access the Kindle), the all usual icons appear and ARE labeled.

- The tablet is shorter and wider than previous generations. This means I can no longer grasp it in one hand, as it is too wide for my small palm and short fingers to hold it. It's also slightly heavier (but only .2 of an ounce).

- The power button and volume buttons have been relocated to the left side of the top end, so I'm having to retrain myself to stop inadvertently powering down the tablet. [Not a con if this is your first Kindle.]

- The front-facing camera has been moved to the center left side of the tablet in portrait mode, so I can't get my head centered unless the tablet is rotated to landscape mode.

- Silk no longer has Amazon, Home, and News tabs across the top. There are 4 permanent gray and black circle icons for Bookmarks, History, Shopping and News. No way to turn those off, that I can find.

- Also on Silk home page, the icons below the permanent gray icons are either My Favorites or Most Recent websites, but there is no way to tell which is which. No label headings separate them. They are also gray circles, though the website icons are in color (depending on the website). I find it very confusing. Previous generation had square icons under My Favorites and thin rectangular label-type icons for under the heading Most Visited. Those were easy to distinguish.

- The touch screen is not as responsive on Silk browser as my 6th generation. It takes 2-3 taps to close a Silk tab, to select a folder for a bookmark, selecting options on a particular web page.

- It is no faster loading than the 6th generation in launching apps or rendering websites. But it isn't any slower than the 6th gen when new, either.

Pros:
- It doesn't seem to get as hot when streaming video as the previous generation.
- It charges faster and the charge lasts significantly longer (but I don't yet have apps installed).
- The Twilight Blue color is beautiful.
- It works as as well as the 6th generation Kindle when it was new. I have very few apps installed on the new 10th generation Kindle yet, but I expect it will handle the additional load just fine.

One other note, the Wi-Fi signal indicator shows only one bar whereas the 6th gen shows 2-3 and th Fire 10 shows 4 in the same room, same location at the furthest distance from the router in my house (single story). However, I have not used it enough in this location to determine if the signal strength affects functionality at all.

Keep in mind I use this Kindle primarily in portrait mode to check email, browse the internet, read books, access calendar and calculator, and set alarms. I don't play games, and I normally watch videos using my Fire 10 HD (bigger screen). So your mileage may vary.

Overall I think it's a fantastic tablet for the cost, and nearly as good as any of the ""i- "" products at a quarter of the price.","08 31, 2020",R2BHJQ4MIDPYHP,Lucy R,Stop "improving" this model! Prefer the earlier generations,1598803200
3,B07TMJ1R3X,"[12, 12]",1,"This is my third Kindle Fire -- well, really my fourth if you count the first Fire 8 that they had to replace because it could not stay online or even find a signal. Like many people, we have multiple wireless devices in our home. This is the only one that has difficulty finding the signal. I have an app on my phone that shows the strength of a wireless signal. Even when it shows an excellent signal, this Fire has difficulty finding that signal anywhere, home or on the road. Amazon promotes the Fire as perfect for portable entertainment. This ascertain has proven false for my Fire. The latency issue is very real and very frustrating. Asked to open a book, the device stalls before moving exceptionally slow. Playing a game, even a simple game such as solitaire is frustratingly slow because the device cannot execute commands at anything other than a snails pace. Videos are out of the question due to the lack of speed and power.

For those sure to criticize this review because they think I do not understand that this is not meant to replace a real tablet such as an iPad or similar tablet, let be debase you of that theory. I am VERY aware this is not that type device. When needed, I carry a tablet. This device is meant to deliver Amazon content and similar programs, something it does very poorly. As stated above, this is my third Fire. I do know what they are capable of doing and what they are not designed for. My previous Fires delivered on the promise of providing access to books and other entertainment. This device does NOT deliver on that promise. I would strongly recommend finding another device to purchase if you want value for your money.

Shortly after submitting my initial review, someone from Amazon contacted me suggesting I contact tech support one more time. Due to my work schedule and other factors, I was unable to do so until today. The short result: I have cancelled both my Prime membership and my Kindle Unlimited subscriptions. Further, I seriously doubt if we will be ordering anything from Amazon in the future.

I was on chat for almost two hours, during which time I was switched from one representative to another three times. Why? I have no idea except that the representatives apparently have a time limit for dealing with customer complaints. Each new rep requested the exact same information I had shared with the previous rep - a waste of my time and a waste of theirs. Each rep offered the same steps toward resolution, the same steps we have tried multiple times. Famous saying: doing the same thing in the same way and expecting different results is insanity. Dealing with Amazon is apparently also insanity.

The Kindle will not permit the downloading of books, apps or games. It is painfully slow in executing any command and in playing any but the most simple games. It continues to lose connectivity regardless of location or wifi type. According to more than one rep, the problem is not the device, but our wifi. This is interesting...like most households, we have multiple wireless enabled devices, including computers, phones and other tablets. None exhibit these issues. In addition, I travel for my work and often have to use public and other private wifi. The Fire exhibits exactly the same issues regardless of which wifi is accessed.

To resolve these ongoing, constant concerns, Amazon's solution was to inform us that the warranty on the Kindle Fire has expired. Please note: this is the third replacement Kindle Amazon sent when the other exhibited similar issues. A rep offered to replace the unit despite it being out of warranty IF we are willing to accept a refurbished unit. This is outrageous and unacceptable. We paid for a NEW Kindle, not a refurbished one. The others failed within weeks of receipt. This one somehow managed to work for a period of less than two months before failing. Therefore we paid for new and now have a device that is essentially useless for our purpose. Stating that the warranty has expired is patently ridiculous. How can a warranty expire when a device fails within a short period of being replaced because the first ones didn't work? If anything the warranty should be extended and applied to the replacement with a NEW (not refurbished) Kindle Fire. That device should come with the same warranty that would apply to one bought now and shipped in operating order.

The ultimate issue is not the device, but the manner in which Amazon chooses to attempt resolution of customer complaints. I have been an Amazon customer for years, almost as long as the company has been in business. In the past, any serious or even minor complaints have been addressed in a polite, customer centric manner. No longer. Perhaps some of the critics are correct in suggesting the company has grown too large and too powerful. Based on my recent interactions, I surmise the company does not give a damn about their customers. Our leaving and canceling Prime will have zero impact on the company, thus they do not have to care about our business. Lesson learned.

Over the years I have purchased probably eight Fire tablets but this is my last one. They are not improving nor are they functioning as advertised. Even though playstore can be side loaded fairly easily, save your pennies and get a real android tablet that works and is not limited to Amazons pathetic app offerings.

When I moved to my brother's house with his generous wifi the 3 devices in question worked just fine. The older devices that kept working must not have needed as much wifi access as the newer devices. Thank goodness I kept them. I'm bumping my rating back up to 4 stars.

update 9/13/21 - ok I mostly use my fire tablets to read and text to speech, but I also like to play a little candy crush and gardenscapes. BUT. The last three devices I bought on 3/29/21 and 8/3/21 and 9/5/21 will no longer connect to wifi. It's not the wifi, I still have a few older kindles and tablets and other devices that connect just fine.
The fire hd 8 I bought 3/29/21 is nearly six months old so I thought maybe that's the current lifespan or I got a lemon oh well. The kindle paperwhite I bought on 8/3/21 connected for a few weeks before refusing wifi so I had already invested the time to load it with my essential library and figured meh I can load new books by connecting the cable to my computer no biggie not worth the hassle of returning. The fire hd 8 I bought 9/5/21 to replace the lemon bought on 3/29/21 lasted all of six days before refusing to connect to wifi, just long enough to register the clunker and put the time into loading it up then splat no wifi.
Either the amazon kindle fairy has put a curse on my house or amazon got stuck with a bunch of cheapie wifi connection parts that don't last in their recent devices. Very disappointing.
I'll use them as grudging backup readers since I can use my computer cable and load them that way but they are useless for anything but reading after side loading via computer cable. Since I hate the hassle of returning things they'll be sitting around reminding me of how disappointing they are having failed their stated use and being used as limp third rate backups for a long time.
-------------------------
original review - Like many others I purchased my fire for it's text to speech ability and find the 30 minute shutoff window intolerable. There is a way around it.

First I disable alexa and turn the wifi off. Then I turn on the airplane mode, do not disturb, and portrait orientation. Then I turn on the text to speech on my book and use the on/off button to switch off the screen.

Basically I eliminate every distraction from solely doing text to speech. This works on both of my recently purchased fire 8 HD tablets as well as the older one. Since I primarily want to move easily between reading and listening to text to speech I don't miss using alexa, and I suspect it is the attempt to multi-task that switches off the text to speech.

The portrait orientation is important, if the fire is trying to switch between orientations with auto rotate it will turn off the text to speech. Also I use old fashioned earbuds that plug into the device with a wire so I don't know if blue tooth would also need to be turned off.

Using this method I'm able to listen to text to speech as long as I like which important when I want to use it on long drives plugged into my car radio. Yes it would be nice to use all the abilities of the tablet at once but for the price I'm content to just use text to speech in a tablet that will hopefully last a year or so. And I can always switch the settings back when I want to play Candy Crush.

Just in case you're having trouble finding it, the text to speech voice option is under Settings>Device Options>Keyboard & Language>Text to Speech to select the voice you want to hear. To turn on the text to speech you need to be in your book in the Kindle app, click on the Aa to pull up the Font Layout Themes More menu and select More, then move down the More menu to turn on the text to speech button.","06 01, 2021",R31UNYHEULCJ51,jjbooks,text to speech success - but no wifi??? ok it was my wifi bandwidth that was insufficient,1622476800
11,B07TMJ1R3X,"[12, 12]",3,"There's a few things to be said about this tablet. It's a budget tablet for people who don't know much about smart devices, and it works well for each and every one of them. So it's got more than a few flaws to them.

Sticking to their guts, the Fire HD 8 10th Gen (2020) still uses a 1280*800 screen, breaking the minimum definition of HD (being 720p). Why it isn't a 1080p in this decade, I will never understand, but you get what you pay for, and this detail doesn't really bother me. This isn't very futuristic either, the bezels are thick and massive, making the screen-to-body ratio only about 70%. Same 2 MP front facing camera, but selfie camera has been improved to match

Broad improvements across the board. Internally it has a better processor, more RAM, updates to wifi and bluetooth, has a better battery inside, and features their fire OS 7, which is a fork of Android 9 (Pie). Externally there's not much to say. It has a better selfie cam, still holds the 3.5mm audio jack, features USB-C to charge the device, also allowing for some USB-C Peripherals to be used with it. Honestly USB-C is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars, my problems lie ahead, and would have otherwise given this 2 stars because of the low price, and 1 star altogether if it were 10 or 20 more.

There's some really large gripes I have with their changes. They placed the front facing camera along the side. While you can use it in landscape to video chat/conference, the placement creates its own issue. Presuming the buttons and i/o are on the ""top"", the selfie camera runs on left, along with the front facing camera being on the top of the same side. This is unusual, and I'll get to why it's a problem in a bit. But first, being left handed myself, I'm holding the device typically in my dominant hand realizing I'm covering the camera, and finding myself to need to rotate the device in order to use it. Selfies become a bit obscure here, but I'll stick to using my cell phone for pictures. Seriously though, they design this so you can do half the things in portrait, and the other half in landscape.

Case manufacturers haven't caught on quickly enough, and when looking for a case with a cover, they all have it fold on the left. Much like a book like you'd expect. And the cases fold in a way where you can stand the case up landscape style along the left side, right where the speakers, and both cameras are. This is where Amazon's ingenuity comes into play, because at the time of this review, Amazon's case is the only one where you have the cover fold like a book, and when you stand it, it's on the right side, allowing the camera to be on the top of the screen, and trust me, you do not want to video call with the camera at the bottom.

I updated my tablet from the larger 2017 model of the Fire HD 10. While smaller, cheaper, and less pixels, I was hoping at the very least to have some of the same features. The one in particular was exFAT support for external storage. For a device that allows a 1TB MicroSD card to input, the device does not support exFAT. This was featured on the Fire HD 10, but unavailable for some unknown reason for this device. This may be because they wanted to have their own proprietary SD storage firmware used with their devices, breaking away (again) from typical android standard programming. Honestly this alone is why I'm giving it such a low score. It'd be a near value match to the other fire devices, but this feels like a downgrade with this one change. And they're doing it because they don't want to pay the license for exFAT from Microsoft, just like they don't want to pay Google to use their Android infrastructure (including their play store)

Well that's amazon in a nutshell, wanting to engineer their own proprietary designs so you buy more amazon.","07 03, 2020",R1VJB4CFH1PQOO,ShadowfoX,Cheap Tablet for simplicity,1593705600

Amazon advertises that you can expand the storage of this device with a micro SD card up to a terabyte of storage. Until recently, you could, but you cannot now.

I learned of this problem a few months ago. I have many Prime videos that I have purchased and have downloaded. For a long time, everything was fine. A few months ago, I started experiencing problems. Videos would only load to the internal memory, not the SD card. I went through 3 Kindle Fires, and 4 SD cards before I realized the problem. When you take this device out of the box, it works perfectly (it has an older software version). You can download videos to the SD card all you like. Then you wake up the next morning, when the software updates have loaded, and you have a problem. You have download errors and a memory overload.

When the software updates, it won't let you store videos on the SD card, only in the internal memory. I have a 256 GB micro SD card, one which is built for the Kindle Fire, that is currently worthless. The Kindle won't download to it,

I still like the Kindle, and I am invested in Prime Videos. I traded in my 32 GB Kindle for a 64 GB Kindle and reduced the quality of the videos I can download, so I can still have my videos when I travel, in the hope they fix this problem.

If or when they fix the download problem, this is a great device and would get five stars. Until then, it only gets one star. It does not allow you to download many videos.

But when I saw the new 8 Plus was coming out and the improvements they were making I decided to really splurge for a change. I order the 64 HD 8 Plus with ""no offers"" so the splurgy price was 154 dollars. I had a friend who ordered the lower priced 32 gig with offers at the same time. I began to wonder if there was a problem with the 64 gig because he's came almost as soon as they were available for shipping where I had to wait almost a month more for mine. When it finally arrived I powered it up with the option to restore all the apps that were backed up in the cloud from my previous Fire 8. During the restore process I received a pop up that the restore had failed. When the set up was finally completed....I could see that the apps that I wanted were all available for down load they were just not downloaded in the set up. So I clicked download all. When all the apps were in place I started opening some. I opened that Amazon App for youtube and the main page opened painfully slow and when I did select a video it would try to load and wouldn't play. I have excellent high speed internet so I knew that wasn't the problem. Every app I opened experienced slow loading. My email apps would time out and I would have to try again. I placed a call to Customer Service support. I was asked to restart the device which I did. After the restart I experienced the same problem. Almost without hesitation the technician said to send the device back and they would send another one. So I sent it back and about 5 days later I received another Fire 8 plus 64 gig. This time I called customer service before activating the device because I wanted to see if the restore would work while I had a tech on the phone. The device loaded properly and restored all the apps from the cloud. Again I went to open the apps starting with youtube and it was slow loading and the vids wouldn't play. The tech asked permission to do a shared session so she could trouble shoot the device. I told her I had to believe there was something wrong with the 64 Gig device. I was on the phone for over an hour with her and still the device did not function properly. So she said the only thing we can do is do a factory restore. Initially I was against this because I had already spent so much time on the phone to no avail. But I relented, so I hit factory reset and then with the tech on the other end of the line we started the whole set up over again including the downloading of the apps from the cloud. This took considerable time. So once again I started with the youtube app but this time the page loaded immediately and the videos played properly. With her on the phone I went through several other apps and these worked fast and the way they should. The tech had no explanation as to what might have been wrong or if the solution was a lasting one. Before we signed off, I mentioned that I had paid the highest price for this HD 8 Plus but that the replacement had come in a different box. So I asked if Amazon had sent me a refurbished HD8 or a brand new one. She told me it was refurbished. I said that I didn't think that was quite fair as I had paid for a new device not a refurbished one. She said they carried the same warranty. So now I have a refurbished expensive device that seems to be working the way it should have been from the start. I have a few more weeks to decide to keep it or return it. For now it works very very well. The streaming quality is good although the sound when turned up the highest without head phones could be louder. Pages load fast as I would expect with 3 gigs of ram. I have not yet added an SD card. And I'm still not crazy about getting a refurbished replacement but at least the warranty is the same. If it continues to work properly then I will probably keep it, but if you are ordering the 64 gig version I would be wary. My friend who has the 32 gig version never had a single problem.

For the price, of $60 w/ being able to pay in 5 monthly installments of $12, it‚Äôs such a great simple deal! It took a bit though to arrive..like 10 days -WITH Prime membership. Anyway, been using for 2 days,& so far so good, i really like it. Simple to use, easy seamless connection wifi, to all my Prime stuff, shopping/music , Bluetooth
etc. Perfect for my purposes. I‚Äôve a 3 year old iphone 8Plus, that is in great condition, though it‚Äôs starting to really lag, slow, & batt is going downward. So, i wanted the Fire tablet for Email/Social media/news, simple everyday stuff, that way, i‚Äôm able to stay off my phone, not wearing it down any further. i had the fire 7, two summers ago, & within a few months it was useless, hopefully they‚Äôve improved the workings of these tablets.

So far It is nice and responsive, connected instantly to my wifi, i easily connected my air pods & sony earphones via Bt. It downloads apps fast. The picture is very quality 1080 HD. Don‚Äôt expect super duper 4K etc. But It‚Äôs fine for me. I tried Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, & You tube, & so far, the video is smooth, seamless, no lag. The speakers are just ok, but i personally always use earbuds/headphones. hopefully this will last me at least a year..give or take üôèüèΩ I‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôd pay $80-$100+ for this, but $60?...is a GREAT deal.

I went through 3 techs, factory resets, answering basic questions (is your WIFi on?). This tablet failed in just 2 months. I should have purchased a Nook. More money but now I know why. I just was on a call with the 4th Amazon rep. The could not guarantee that a replacement Fire 8 would not be a refurbished unit. Why? I've been chatting for 30 minutes now. No answers. That makes no sense. They are attempting to refund me my original payment. ""I am afraid the replaced devices are chosen automatically. We cannot manually choose if the device is new or refurbished."" Does that make sense? You purchase what you were told was a brand new tablet but a replacement could be a refurbished? I'm not even sure the reps I talked to were actually real people. Chat bots?

If you're thinking of purchasing one for Christmas, be careful. Right after your return date expires, it could fail. And even though you thought you were purchasing a new tablet, you most likely are getting something used and not reliable. That is what I'm led to believe here. Customer Service will be difficult to work with and will take hours. And not necessarily any resolution. Amazon is changing and it is not for the good. Very sad to see.

So they promised a refund in a gift card. My gift card balance is $0.00. And the chatter cut me off. I can't communicate any longer. unbelievable. Dishonest. Horrible customer experience. Who cares?","11 15, 2020",R92X4LY1FP0J9,Jim E Johnson,"Poor Technology, Not Worth It",1605369600

Pros:
One more inch (8 ‚Äô‚Ä?
New version of FIRE OS
Dolby Atmos
Connecting with Chrome and media similar devices to send data to TV
Flash memory expansion slot

Cons:
The volume up, volume down and power on / off buttons are designed in such a way that holding the Tablet vertically accidentally is pressed, turning the Tablet, the hand covers the camera and light sensor. In the 3rd generation version the button was hidden, making it impossible to accidentally press it.
The light sensor that manages the brightness of the screen, when you see an image/video, the sensor detects it and lowers the brightness a lot. Something that did not happen with the previous generation either. I had to disable the brightness sensor as it went up and down very often and bothered to read or see something.
Regarding the protector, the origami design that it had before, in addition to folding much more, the Tablet was placed perfectly by the magnet it had. This new design only folds once, and has no magnet, the tablet must be forced to wedged into it.
The memory expansion is blocked when placing the protector, it is not very comfortable.

Set up: This was really easy and I selected the option of tieing it to my account when I was purchasing it so when it powered on and started the set up process it already had my saved wifi password on it. It pulled info I had saved on NY account like my kids profiles and it set up profiles for the 3 of them.

Installing Apps: The Amazon Appstore isn't the greatest and feels, looks, and performs ""old"". The app selection is terrible and there seems to be a lot of abandoned apps. The process for installing an app is slow and is slow on all my devices (I'm on a 500mb down internet connection, and use the appstore on recent, high end devices).

Performance: This tablet runs like you would expect a $45 tablet should. I primarily bought it for 2 tasks, to play Roblox and Minecraft and it does one well. Roblox plays as it should and isn't bad but when it comes to Minecraft it is a laggy experience. Some other games seem to play well (Toca Food 1 and 2).

User Interface: I have mixed feelings about the user interface. On one hand it looks fairly nice and modern but on the other hand it also looks old and dated. I say this because the color palette is nice but the large text for the ""tabs"" remind me very much of the old metro style from the Microsoft Zune. Coming from a normal Android device, the way some of the UI works is different from just about everything (like getting into the options/settings on my kids profile) and watching my kids trying to use it for the first time (they have experience with Android, Chrome OS, and iOS) they struggled to do things they wanted to do like change their profile icon (the parent has to do it).

It charges much faster via USB C, and it seems to last longer on a charge. The Show function is really nice. The speakers sound better on this version. It stays connected to WIFI without any issues.
When buying a Fire Tablet, there are a few things to keep in mind:
-it is NOT an IPad or a droid. It only runs apps that are available from the Amazon App store, which can be limited. No maps, Google docs, etc.
- it is mainly a media content device. Games can run slowly. But it handles most streaming channels, zoom works well, it makes a great Kindle reader, and it handles most social media apps.
- it does NOT have GPS. The WIFI location function is pretty useless.
- it has full Alexa capability. If you want an Echo Show, but don't want to dish out a bunch of money, this tablet is a very reasonable substitute. Except for the sound quality, of course, although you can connect it to a Bluetooth speaker for better sound.

47,B07TMJ1R3X,"[5, 5]",5,"This is my first ever Kindle device. For reading ebooks I've always used the Kindle app on my phone. I don't have a lot of experience with tablets, but I will share my thoughts on the Kindle Fire HD8. I was eagerly looking forward to reading ebooks on this tablet. I didn't expect to enjoy watching videos on it so much. Prime, Netflix, etc. The picture is really vibrant. I can also play games, listen to Amazon Music, and search the internet with the Silk browser. There are a lot of different apps available, including Zoom. (I haven't tried a Zoom meeting on the Fire yet) Of course I can shop on Amazon and check on my orders. The size is just perfect. The screen is large enough for anything I would do on it, yet the whole thing is small enough to slip into my purse and take with me on the go. This would be awesome for commuting or travel. I can't wait to take it on the road. I like that the screen ""wakes up"" automatically when I open the cover of the case I purchased for it. I added an SD card that doubles its storage space and allows me access to the downloaded items when I'm not on wifi. This is a big plus. Not that I have come close to using all the storage space yet. I've connected bluetooth headphones to it just fine.

There are some limitations with the Kindle. I've discovered that I can't download the Gmail app, but I can access my gmail account through the Silk browser. There is a Kindle email app available, but I'm not using it. There are some other apps that aren't available in the Kindle app store. For most of those apps that I want, I have been able to download them from outside sources, once I change my Kindle settings to allow for it. Each time I think I've found something that won't work on this tablet, I figure out a way to make it work.

I can see how a more expensive tablet might give you more options (iPad). But if you are using the tablet mostly for ebooks and videos, this is a great choice. It is a LOT more than an reader. I think I will be able to accomplish everything I want to with this Fire tablet, and the price point is pretty good. I researched several different tablets to make my decision.

48,B07TMJ1R3X,"[3, 3]",5,"I upgraded a Fire 7 to a Fire 8 because the microUSB on the Fire 7 became unreliable for charging. The Fire 8 has a USB-C charging port, which addresses the problem, and hopefully is a long-term fix. My Fire 7 was delightful, and I was sorry to retire it before its useful life played out. The Kindle Fire 8 retains the excellent book presentation and the Washington Post, both of which have become central in life during the Covid pandemic. It is a bargain for the what it gives to the owner.

Not all is perfect, however. The first Kindle 8 failed within a day when I attempted to install a large collection of MP3 albums. Many, but not all, were purchased from Amazon. They were all installed on my Fire 7, so I know that everything worked fine on that tablet. For the Fire 8, I had problems with some albums when using the Fire 8 built-in music player. These may have been albums that did not come from Amazon. The Kindle went into a loop where it crashed, booted up automatically, worked OK for a minute, then repeated. I could not stop the looping, and the tablet failed after doing this a few times. All the suggestions from Amazon technical support were unable to revive it. So Amazon sent a replacement at no charge, and I returned the failed item. Amazon's policy for customer service is superb; Kindle Fire 8's music player --- not so great. On my replacement Kindle I downloaded a third party MP3 player app which seems to do the job. I was able to load my entire MP3 collection, including albums from Amazon and other sources, without a problem. Because there are a bunch of MP3 apps, I suggest that music enthusiasts look through them before picking a particular one. The one I am using has a much better user interface than the native Kindle Music player, which make selection of albums and creation of playlists much easier. It may not be the best UI out there, but it shows that the Kindle's Music UI leaves much to be desired.

The transition from one Kindle to the next was exceptionally easy (except for the music collection problem noted above). I had to remove my Kindle Fire 7 from my devices on my Amazon account, and make my new Kindle Fire 8 my default Amazon device. I downloaded a few apps that I had installed on Fire 7, I logged into a few accounts on the new Kindle. And that was it. It did not take long, and I was up and running.

I have been using Amazon e-readers for about 10 years. The experience has been wonderful. A big plus is the local library which has a great collection of Kindle books that are deliverable over the Amazon net using the Overdrive app. I still purchase some Kindle books that are not available from the library. These are delivered instantly. For the library, I am usually wait listed, but they come eventually. As long as I an not in a hurry to read a particular book, my reader queue is full. The consequence over a 10-year period is that I have logged about 1000 books. My tastes include great literature so I have read almost all of the prize winning novels (and many of the finalists) for virtually all literary prizes in that time period. If I had read these in hardcover, the logistics of purchase, storage, and eventual disposal of those books would have been a burden, that is totally avoided. No trees cut, no shipping containers, no storage shelves, and no recycling to a landfill. Since most of those were library books, it was a big financial savings for me. I hope that the royalties and license fees paid by the libraries are adequate compensation for the authors. While each library may contribute less than if the readers had purchased the books, many of the library readers (like myself) would not have purchased the books at all. So the Kindle has helped to create a readership that otherwise may not have existed. The world is a better place when literary art is widely read and appreciated.","08 22, 2020",R3RJO9I0OKKQ1T,H.

49,B07TMJ1R3X,"[5, 5]",4,"I will try and write a tough but fair review. I bought the fire HD 8 as an upgrade from the 7' 2015 model I was using. It's an improvement in almost every way. Smoother transitions, screen resolution, battery life, faster processor, more storage. For me it was a considerable upgrade. I prefer the old charging port over usb C. I cannot compare the 2020 model to the 2019 model. Just look at the specs side by side and decide whether or not it's worth it

Now as a general tablet you're not going to do better for the price. I'm not the kind of person that's willing to spend $200 on a tablet unless I'm going to use it all day. I used it primarily as an e reader, and to watch movies and TV on the go. Take it with me on trips. it is geared towards the Amazon ecosystem so if that's a problem this is not the tablet for you. Overall it's a great tablet. I think its biggest drawback is that it does not have access to the Google play store. When people hear Android tablet they think it's going to have the same interface as their android phone. it would be really nice if Google and Amazon would come to some sort of arrangement so the play store is available. The other major downside is that the screen resolution is not 1080p. So behind the times. I would be willing to pay a little more money for a better screen resolution.

I wanted an inexpensive tablet to bring to work to be able to listen to music, and browse the internet during breaks, as well as for home to play the couple of games I like playing. This does fit the bill, though I guess you get what you pay for, because even right out of the box, it's slow. Something as simple as hitting the icon to see open apps can be annoying - sometimes it takes a few seconds for the screen to load. I also hate that Gmail app isn't available, because the Amazon email app sucks (I can't even change the swipe settings). Generally, the apps also load and function slower - little glitches here and there like it takes an extra second for the app to catch up to what you tapped on.
The battery life so far is good, even after having Spotify on for a few hours, it doesn't drain a lot.
Overall, if you're looking for something simple and aren't concerned about speed, this is fine - but don't pay full price. Wait for it to be on sale.","08 26, 2021",R22CSTNUPVF7L1,Sognare G,Just okay,1629907200

I was looking to upgrade my 1st Gen 16GB iPad Air (2013?) to a faster processor and smaller size tablet so its fits into my hand better without paying the ""Apple Premium"" with the newest iPad Mini.

I had Android tablets and phones in the past but ended with Apple stuff because they seemed to just work better. The Android ecosystem is too fragmented. I do own some Ring and other Amazon products that use Alexa. The one thing Apple is behind on is the connected home IMO.

When the Kindle Fire 8 HD dropped in price and after reviewing all the specs it seemed like it would be a pretty decent replacement for my 1st Gen iPad Air. And no this is not a comparison between the Fire 8 HD and iPad mini but simply my impression of the Fire.

Setup: pretty straight forward, connect to home wifi and just need an Amazon account.
Kindle Launch Screen: a bit confusing at first as I was used to stock Android launch screen but it has been awhile.
Screen: Had the brightness turned all the way up but still looked kind of dull. The icons wasn't pixellated but didn't look sharp either when I compared with my iPad Air. (I believe the ipad has almost twice as many pixels). However, when I ran Netflix the picture was great.
Speakers/Sound: The dual speakers definitely made a huge difference when watching movies and playing games. Clear and sharp.
Processor/Apps/Speed: There seemed to be a slight lag sometimes and even when swiping between screens. I was hoping with Quad Core it would be a bit smoother. As I mentioned, with videos it seemed to play fine and screen was actually quite good for watching and there didn't seem to be any lag. The only game I played was Marvel Strike Force and some of the animation didn't seem as smooth but I don't know if its the game or the tablet itself. On the iPhone XR the game runs pretty smooth. Even when swiping in the game it seemed laggy.

Overall: Given the price point, it is a decent tablet for casual use if you understand its limitations like for web browsing, watching videos, gaming? Laptop replacement - no, it's an 8 inch screen anyway. It's a great tablet for a young child.

So, this is quite a downgrade compared to what I'm used to (3GHz octo-core to 2GHz quad-core CPU, 6GB RAM to 2GB, 279ppi 120Hz to 189ppi 60Hz display). Out of the box it was fairly responsive, but as soon as I loaded it up with a bunch of apps, the lag launching or switching applications became very noticeable. Sometimes it even lags using applications. But for its intended purpose, watching video, it does quite well without skips or drops. The image quality is a bit soft and colors a bit washed out compared to the more premium Samsung display, but for 1/10th the price, it's a reasonable compromise.

One reason for the poor performance is the fact that I got the 32 GB edition and added an SD card; SD cards are always slower than internal storage. But it didn't make sense to pay a $30 premium for 32GB more internal storage on a budget tablet, when a 64GB SD card is $10. If you're looking for performance, this isn't the tablet to buy anyway.

While this tablet sits in a very sweet spot in the price/performance ratio, my main complaint is the slow charging. For the life of me I can't understand why Amazon made this choice unless they're using second-rate batteries that can't handle ""normal"" fast charging speeds, which doesn't bode well for longevity (all lithium batteries wear out with charge/discharge cycles, after a year or two the battery life will be reduced compared to new).

Well, at the same time I bought the Fire 8, I bought a Vori case for it. Recently I discovered that the reason the screen goes black was related to the CASE not the Fire 8. The case has a velcro tab that latches to the case, behind the Fire 8. One day, I undid the velcro tab and pulled it out from behind the Fire 8. Immediately, my screen was ON--no longer black.

I am a long time iPhone user. There are several significant drawbacks to being an iPhone user who also loves music, headphones, DACs, amps, etc. The fixed storage, the lack of options for Bluetooth (literally AAC, which is alright but still heavily compresses the file, or SBC, which isn't even worth talking about), and the wonderfully finicky lightning connector. Making an iPhone work means 1) You're going to need an unlimited data plan (or a constant wifi connection), 2) You're probably going to want to USB-DAC everything, and 3) You'll also need a couple Apple branded camera adapters on hand because finding replacement lightning to anything cables is nearly impossible (or expensive, or requires about a month to have it shipped to you). Suffice to say, I was really tired of having my iPhone as my only source device. Most DAPs are too expensive for the price and you receive an incredibly buggy UI. Tried the M11 and M11 Pro and it wasn't for me. Had a stroke of genius and thought, ""The Fire HD is only like $90, why I don't try that"". So glad I did.

Now, I've got an iPad Pro so everything about the Fire HD 8 feels cheap. The screen is 1080p with a significantly lower refresh rate, the colors are meh, etc. etc. It's $89. The battery life is surprisingly good. The Amazon app store isn't great, but you can download apk to the tablet and it'll run it perfectly well - which is great because 80% of the apps you would use an audiophile are not on the Amazon app store. You will want to download APK Pure. The UI isn't quick or anything. Again, it's $89.

Here are a few things that sold me on this tablet for my audiophile hobby:
1) You can stick a microSD in it. I bought a 256 GB microSD (I believe this gen of Fire HD can handle up to 1TB) and downloaded my entire Tidal library to it which is probably about 7,000 songs.
2) It has LDAC! I can use my BTR5 with this on LDAC and the connection is so stable, I can walk around my whole house which is great. Compared to AAC on my iPhone, I couldn't be more than like 20 feet from my iPhone and any walls interrupted connection immediately.
3) The Fire HD will do USB out to a DAC and will do it without the need of a special OTG or camera adapter cable. I'm not sure how it works. My only concern was if the Fire HD would compress the file before it even sent it to the DAC for decoding. According to the RGB indicators, however, everything seems to be running HiRes which is 24bit/96kHz minimum (I believe).
4) Its a tablet (a small one granted) so its got a really good pro and a great con. The larger screen makes it super easy to navigate on (nothing like trying to navigate on the FiiO M6) but it also reduces its portability. Its not really a burden to carry around - I just can't fit it into my pocket.
5) It's $89.

If you're like me and you're looking for an audio source that can run Tidal, has expandable storage, is moderately portable, good battery life, USB-DAC compatible, and let's you keep your iPhone (I could switch to Android but what's the fun in that) - then I highly recommend the FireHD8. It's $89.

Side note: If anyone from Amazon reads this - I'd love to see a collaboration between Amazon and Drop (or some other audio giant) to create a DAP that has all the components we want, a usable UI (one that isn't riddled with bugs preferably), and doesn't cost four figures to own. Just something in that sweet spot between consumer friendly and audiophile niche that isn't the iPod. If Amazon isn't up for that, then some other tech giant would be great.","10 24, 2020",R1AGZPEM94C3JA,Preston J.,Audiophile Review,1603468800

And, if one waits for Amazon sales events, the gouge to the pocket book isn't that deep.

So, when my old first edition Fire finally stopped keeping a charge- yes, that means that device lasted a very long time- good quality obviously- I chose not to go with the very latest and went for next to the latest. I don't use my Kindle for much more than reading, but I have developed an enjoyment for audiobooks, a few apps, and like to watch a historical show now and then, so this one seemed to cover all the bases. It also takes good pictures, has good audio quality, and is as lightweight as they promise. It also holds a charge for nearly a week for me reading on it everyday for a few hours and listening to stories as well. Granted, I did add some memory so it wasn't having to chug so much as I downloaded what I wanted on it.

It is as user-friendly as my old Fire and I love the larger screen. I got used to a color screen so that was another factor I appreciate about the Fire. I watched a bit of one of my shows and it played it easily so I know that works. I'm sure there is much more that it can do, but it does at the very least all I need from it.

The other option states that it has wireless charging but that option is not enabled unless you buy the charging for another $40 dollars. Both of these 2 are not clear when you buy the Kindle or when it is shipped to you. This needs to be more clearly stated in the information for the 8th generation because it makes the Kindle appear false - which it is. I knocked off a star for the above reasons
Now to the Fire itself. It is amazing and has great sound, clarity of screen, Alexa which I did not expect because I thought I had to have the Dot, games that I can play, etc. All of these things are truly wonderful. The great thing that I like are the books which automatically became accessible after registering it. Fantastic!!!!

Another reason to take off a star: no manual - just have to ask for help with Alexa. I usually like to read a manual to become familiar with a new product and that is not possible for this one (unless you pay more money to download it from someone who has made it possible).

33,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",3,"I was looking for a wall-mounted pad to centralize and control my Alexa-based smart home. For the price, you can't beat it, but it's a hack (at best) with mixed results. The HD8 is a perfect size for this kind of application.

There are several aftermarket wall mounts, I'm very happy with the one I got, but I did need to saw it to get access to the volume controls. You will need to access them frequently so look for a mount with exposed volume buttons. My mount has wired USB power but there are several options from POE to mains on most available 3rd party mounts.

Smart Home Dashboard:

The ""show mode"" has a dedicated button on the lower task bar which is handy, but it only surfaces ~50% of your smart devices and lacks support for groups, routines and other functionality. You'll still need to launch the native Alexa App to have the needed functionality. The native Alexa App is UGLY on this device as compared to the stock android version. It can only show in white (light theme), and it's missing a GUI ‚Ä?it looks like a 1990's HTML web page that doesn't have CSS support.

The main challenges I'll share are two-fold; making the user experience streamlined, and integrating with media playback.

User Experience

Shovelware! The price is low because this is jam-pact with marketing shovelware, everything is crammed with upsells, recommendations, and tons of clutter. Getting the GUI to be simple and intuitive requires a lot of setup config to systematically remove all the clutter, but it is possible with dedication. The stock desktop backgrounds are all bright and busy, I had to link to my Amazon photos and upload a solid grey image to replace the crazy graphics because there are no solid color stock backgrounds available in the settings.

There's an upsell when you buy the pad to ""remove lock-screen ads"" you absolutely should buy that option unless you want a crazy distracting flashing panel on your wall.

I suggest enabling the recent apps ""continue"" option on the homescreen setting that creates a large UI component with the last 6 apps used. Much easier to see than a cluster of small icons spread over the desktop. This is a great feature and should be developed more. In my application as a smart home dashboard, 6 featured apps are more than enough.

Media Playback

The speakers on the pad are tiny and cheap, you'll need to bluetooth or hard-wire from the headphone jack to get any acceptable sound. It supports the Alexa multi-room speaker groups feature, but you'll need to add the phrase ""play XXX on the XXX group"" everytime you ask for audio playback, and limit yourself to only a few Amazon sanctioned music services, I think that's a really terrible user experience.

You can bluetooth to another Echo speaker, but if that speaker is set up as a stereo pair, you'll only get it to play on one, not both. Basicly the media playback functionality is sub par and needs a lot of work.

For my application, I elected NOT to use the pad for the Alexa/music speaker group support and instead bluetooth it to my network Yamaha receiver. This decision was partly because I use the PLEX app to serve my home media needs, and the PLEX skill only works locally on any given Alexa device and is blocked from using speaker groups. I'd need to enjoy my music on the tablet's 1/4"" speakers, or bluetooth to an external device.

To complicate matters further this solution required me to use the Yamaha AV Controller android app to remotely choose inputs and receiver volume or‚ÄîI'd need to run back to the media hub to change the receiver settings defeating the purpose of a remote pad.

Unfortunately, the Yamaha AV Controller android app is not available in the Fire Appstore as is typical with all other audio-gear manufacturer apps. The Fire App Store is for your children. It's only has super-basic apps but with thousands of games for kids‚Äîlittle for the grown-ups‚Äîand none for my purpose.

I won't advocate that you violate the Amazon terms of service, but I was able to get the Yamaha AV Controller android app installed after some research and effort. I don't suggest you try this unless you're comfortable with android system alterations, but it is possible to put Google Play Services on the pad with the full play store app catalog. We'll see how long it works until future Fire updates break it.

Bottom Line

Pros:

‚ÄîPrice
‚Ä?rd party mounting options

Cons:

‚ÄîShovelware!!
‚ÄîLack of full device support in ""show mode""
‚ÄîUgly native Alexa app
‚ÄîSub-par media connectivity
‚ÄîLimited to Amazon-sanctioned music services
‚ÄîApp store lacking apps for grown-ups
‚ÄîLimited config/UI options

Someday Amazon will evolve their Echo hardware with added 5.1 abilities and I'll likely toss my receiver in favor of a native 5.1 Echo solution. Running two independent sound systems, with two independent speaker sets isn't a great experience, but clearly Amazon is working towards a better home media environment. They will need to have support non-amazon music/media services, especially local playback services like PLEX as any ""owned"" media is currently blocked in their ecosystem, like many others, I'm not happy paying monthly service fees to rent the media I already own and Amazon has stopped allowing user uploads to their music services‚Äîonly Amazon-purchased music is available. Nope, not a usable solution!

Even with all the limitations, I believe it's a tortured but acceptable solution for a centralized dashboard if you're willing to do what it takes to get it to look and function properly.

37,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",5,"Having owned a 7th gen Fire8 since they were first discounted (4 years+?), I wondered when would be a good time to upgrade and if the upgrade would actually be worth the money; would I get better performance? And what does ""better performance"" mean?

I'm happy to report that this 10th gen model is faster - enough so that web browsing and doing eMail isn't a PITA. There are a few other apps I use that ""feel"" faster (I have no benchmarks to report), as well.

This 10th gen model may be hacked to run Google's PlayStore and, therefore, PlayBooks (which I prefer to Amazon's Kindle-walled-garden). I do love the backlit screen as it lets me read in much lower light levels than the e-ink Kindle models. Yeah; I know about the ring of lights around the e-ink Kindle's screen but I get a cleaner image with true backlighting.

One thing I found very quickly as I was searching for a good, protective case/cover: The new locations of the front camera -and- the speakers means that virtually all the third-party case/covers either open left-to-right (instead of the traditional right-to-left) and/or position the speakers at the bottom rather than at the top when propped up in landscape mode. Those that do manage to keep the speakers at the top tend to have holes punched into what would be described as a ""living hinge""; I've seen a number of reports that these covers tear off!

[Edit: Third-party covers also seem to have ""too-powerful"" magnets so that when the cover is flipped around to the rear (which is the usual method when reading), the magnets activate the sleep function (which should only be activated when the cover is on the front side).

So my solution was to simply buy the genuine Kindle case/cover sold by Amazon as it resolves all of these issues (as in ""doesn't have them""). It was about $10 more than the ""cheap"" third-party units but I don't see this unit needing to be replaced. I can't vouch for the amount of protection offered by this case (as I have never dropped my Kindles) but it does protect it well when I pack it into my ""technology bag"" for travel or in a coat pocket. You may find that case/cover here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y8YNDM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 (Note I bought the charcoal unit but there are other colors.)","04 03, 2022",R1GYHB6M19DYDC,B.

I have had my Fire 8 (10th generation) for two days. I am terribly disappointing in the audio volume. If you are expecting ""Spinal Tap's"" 11, you are getting ""The Carpenter's"" 5. I have tried ""Amazon Music"" and I-Heart Radio.

This is my third Kindle. I never had an issue with the maximum audio volume (Note that my genre of choice is folk rock/alternative.). My current Samsung S6 at least doubles the audio volume. I called Amazon (Thank you for letting me talk to a human.). The representative said that it was the best the unit could offer.

The unit boast two speaker. It is a shame you can't turn them up.

I will go back to using my phone to listen to tunes as I read on my porch. If Amazon or anyone can offer a suggestion on improving the audio volume on the device, it will be welcomed.

44,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",3,"I've had my 2017 model for several years now and liked it. So I decided to upgrade when I saw that there were deals on the 2020 version. I'm not so sure it was worth it. I currently own both of them and have had ample opportunity to compare them side by side. After several days of frustration have decided to vent my opinion in my review.

The new one has more memory to load apps and has a slightly faster processor so things run a little smoother. Those are good things, but there are many design changes which are not so nice.

The old one has the camera on the portrait side making it a little narrower and easier to handle, almost like holding a large phone, which is very nice for reading online books. The new one has the camera on the landscape side so the tablet is wider and unwieldy. You can't really figure out how to grip it and are almost forced to use a stand.

The screens have the same pixels but the 2020 version is darker and won't get as bright as the old one.

The 2017 sound quality was never great but the 2020 sound is even worse. It won't get as loud and sounds muffled, not nearly as crisp as the old one sounded.

However the most annoying thing to me are the power and volume buttons. On the 2017 model they projected out a nice distance so they were easy to feel, were silver colored so they were easy to see, and were spaced far apart so they were easy to find and not confuse between volume and power. On the 2020 version these buttons are reduced in height so you can't feel them, are now colored black so you can't see them, and are shoved closer together so you are not sure if you are on volume or power. You actually have to turn the tablet edge toward you to look at it so you can see which button you are pushing. This was clearly a design change for style with very little thought for functionality. To make it even worse the volume buttons have been programmed to switch position depending on the orientation of the tablet. If you are in landscape mode the top right button will be volume up. But if you turn the tablet to portrait mode the very same button becomes volume down! How silly is that? You never really know which way you are turning the volume until you see the volume tray pop up on the screen!

If this is your first tablet then this is not a bad one for the money. But if you are contemplating an upgrade move I would say that the annoyances outweigh the benefits. If Old Faithful is working fine I would say to forget about switching and just keep it.","02 01, 2022",R391Q53FFB1ETP,Tradewinnz,Not much improvement from 2017 model.

I had used computers for years, but I had never had any one on one time with a touch tablet. I spent $145.00 on that first tablet, and I liked it so much I hung on to it for over seven years. Every time I turn on my Kindle Fire I feel like a super spy. Did James Bond ever have a gadget that could do so much? Talk about convenient. With one tool I can catch up on all the latest news, read a New York Times Bestseller, watch the latest Hollywood Blockbuster, listen to all my favorite music, play video games, keep in touch with friends and family, write, take, edit and share photos, learn a new language (Thanks Duolingo!) and so much more. Best of all the Kindle Fire tablets are easily affordable. So what's not to love? I traded my 3rd Gen in for an 8 inch 10th Gen. This new device has front and rear cameras, and hands free Alexa, so it can do everything my old Kindle did and so much more. With the trade in I paid about half of what that first one cost, and this new device has 32 Gigabytes of storage and a Micro SD slot.

The 8 is fast ENOUGH, and responsive ENOUGH.

Great for word games, lite browsing, Prime music, Prime video, and Prime shopping!

Screen control is good for reading ... You can set the blind to sepia or green, and there is a full complement of font setup choices.

It is an Amazon consumption machine, not a laptop replacement!

No apps for Zillow or Kasa or webmail. No alternative browser, tho Silk is ok. No Audacy, but TuneIn is there. No mainstream text, but you can use Skype. Does anyone use Skype in the USA?

There's plenty of tv ... Peacock, Pluto, CBS, Paramount, generally a full suite of tv. I guess Jeff had to cave here, in order to sell Fire STICK.

Spotify and Pandora are available too!

So, bottom line is that it WORKS and the price is low (especially when on sale).

Given the price, I won't have anxiety about taking it to the park or stuffing it in a backpack. And it's small enough to go anywhere.

Speakers are good ENOUGH, and you can hook into headphones jack or Bluetooth.

Cool factor, if you like Alexa, this device is a hands free echo, even if not in show mode. Don't want hands free Alexa, you can turn it off.

I love this tablet! Got it during Black Friday for only $44, and I don't regret it at all. It is super affordable, and many can own this tablet. I bought it so that I don't have to take my Macbook to the park for my personal bible studies. I now have something small and portable to take bible notes. After figuring out how to download Playstore, I fell more in love, and I am utilizing it for everything. Just purchased a wireless keyboard for it, and my case is coming this week. Can't wait!

She wasn‚Äôt able to figure out the game download issue however, so she transferred me to another rep to help. That second rep was able to help me out within 10 minutes.

I traded my older generation HD8 for this newer one, which I regret. At first, this newer HD8 worked beautifully and I was very happy with it. Within just a couple of months however it‚Äôs become very glitchy, especially when it comes to downloading new books and games to it. You can see in my attached pictures that the tablet stays stuck on ‚Äúdownloading‚Ä?without actually downloading anything at all. It‚Äôs been stuck ‚Äúpreparing to download‚Ä?the Fishdom game for over two weeks. Restarting, and turning off and back on multiple times have not helped at all.

7,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",4,"-This is a review for the new Fire HD 8 tablet

My Experience: I actually bought this for a family member of mine and wasn't meant for me, however the family member in question gave me the tablet back and I saw that someone else's account was already preloaded onto this tablet along with my own account. The tablet had a passcode of some sort that I couldn't figure out and I couldn't understand it since the tablet's language setting was set to French. Thankfully one factory reset later and I was able to setup my account and was able to use the tablet however I'm docking 1 star because of that, I'm tech savvy but I'm sure the average customer would have just returned the tablet and left a 1 star review on the product.

The tablet itself is fine really, I got it on sale for around $54.99 before tax and it's a solid tablet for the kids if you want them distracted. There's type-c this time around which is a major improvement in my opinion and it's about time they made the switch. You can get the google playstore loaded onto this tablet, might have to do a bit of research on that but it is possible and definitely worth it but the gaming experience won't all be there, I tried playing one of my games called Monster Super League and it was not running so great and I had to turn on low quality graphics and it was still chugging a bit and switching between characters was really slow. My younger brother plays Roblox on it and he hasn't really complained thus far, so all depends on the game. This tablet however is not meant for gaming, it's meant for being a versatile E-reader that can also play YouTube videos and play some light games on the side and at this price point it's really hard to complain and I can easily give this tablet a recommendation, especially if you manage to catch it on sale.

Positive:
+ Type-C charging
+ Very inexpensive
+ Very nice size
+ Viewing angles aren't that bad

Neutral:
| Can load the google playstore, however tinkering will be required
| plastic build quality all around

Negative:
- Already had another person's account preloaded onto the tablet
- Had to factory reset it in order to access the tablet at all

Recommended: Definitely a strong recommendation if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet that you can just hand off to your kids or just want something to enjoy your e-books on","11 11, 2020",RU1AETQ8DAIW3,SenseiPichu SenseiPichu,"Came with another account already on board, decent tablet for the price",1605024000
8,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",4,"I bought an Amazon Fire HDX 7 when it was first released nearly a decade ago. It was a stellar Kindle edition with a great screen, a comfortable feel and a burgeoning reputation as the best reading tablet on the market. Given that track history, I took a chance and upgraded to a Fire HD 8 in late January 2021. My buy-in wa predicated on the fact that Amazon would provide a $15 trade-in credit on my near-mint condition HDX 7. Long story short: Amazon rejected the HDX 7 trade-in and charged me the additional $15. Worse, they sent me an ad-supported HD 8 when I clearly had placed a slightly more expensive non-ad edition in my online cart. it subsequently cost me an additional $15 to cancel the ads showing up on the Fire HD 8 home screen.

As for the Fire HD 8 unit itself, there's not much to be overjoyed about. The software is fine but it's still Amazon-based and does not play well, if at all, with Mac or Android devices. The requisite Silk browser is several generations behind Google's Chrome or Apple's Safari. The screen is clear but, really, it looks and feels like a step backward from the HDX 7 screen. Also, the overall design of the unit in one's hands is a bit clunky. I have yet to sit and read with the unit held in my hands for any period longer than 10 minutes; invariably I need to prop it up on a pillow or set it against something.

I don't know at what exact file size the device will decide it's too much and cap your image resolution. I tried 10MB-300MB lossless photos I had made. But when I zoomed in and waited for the screen to update, it still showed a very pixilated image. It could still be a limitation of the various apps I tried, but I find it troubling that in 2020-2021 the 8"" Fire HD out-of-the-box makes me feel like tech is falling backwards and I'm stuck in the 90's, looking at pixilated image after image. To display and zoom into a 10MB-100MB image shouldn't be an issue today.","09 22, 2021",R2Y9K33UQZJ35O,Llia O.,Great for entertainment. Not great at viewing images... in detail.,1632240000

The cons I have experienced so far is that that i ended up paying $65 out the door- I know there is tax but I wish they would be upfront with the electronic waste fee (no big deal). Then I realized there are ads popping up on my wake screen, so after some research I found out that at some point I ""agreed"" to that for a $15 discount??? (on my invoice it says (-$35) deal of the day, nothing else. SO now if I want to get rid of them I have to pay $15...just cuz. So far I've only seen it on the wake screen, but read they can pop up other places. Lastly, it most definitely needs a case, and the case amazon made for it is $30- half of what I paid for the actual device- that just annoys me. My son has the previous model with the kids case and that has worked really well for him, except he recently dropped it just right and shattered his screen- so get a screen cover too if this is for a child, or you plan on carry it around with you a lot. I have had a couple glitches here and there but nothing that wasn't easily remedied.
Pros- the price is amazing , even if it is annoying to pay so much more for accessories. It does everything it should. I like that it has the goodreads app, because I was already using that to help me find books to read. I thought books would be cheaper in digital form, they are still a little more than I want to spend- but I am happy to support authors instead of buying used books. I bought this so I can let my 3 year old play academic games and watch you tube on occasion (when I have to do her hair, cut fingernails, etc.) instead of doing that on my Iphone where she has erased things. And so I can use the e-reader, and have a spare portable device. For that, it is perfect.

Plus its easier to walk around with, and way cheaper if I have an accidental drop, than if I was shuffling around with my laptop. It seems pretty snappy and it can run all my movie streaming services on it. My only complaint is the screen is highly reflective, in my opinion. It doesn't appear to have any sort of antiglare properties, or they are not good enough if it does. Its difficult to read while in the sun or even in a well light room. I also hate when a screen shows my reflection every time a movie scene is dark. I play with the angles to avoid direct lighting but its best viewed in the shade. Maybe you won't find this to be too bad, but for me its almost a deal breaker. Luckily I also own a few Kindle E-Readers, including the Oasis, so I just use those when I want to do some reading.

I have had Kindles which I use for reading, I have a Windows tablet and a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 tablet, the latter two have pretty much made me decide against tablets. The Windows tablet takes a bit too long to start up and it's slow and the screen iffy. The Samsung was okay until it updated to the latest OS at the time and that dropped battery life drastically. I never really used the pen input much either which is what I bought it for. I've been using my phone to play FV 2: Country Escape and lately it's been sluggish and unresponsive and I can't get the game to play on a Windows PC!

Hopefully, at least from the bigger version, it seems that FV doesn't kill the battery as fast as on the phone.

It's a nice size to hold, not too big, not too small. The weight is okay, the screen is responsive.

First, there is nearly zero support for this tablet. Almost no standard apple/android apps are available, even ones that should be a bare-minimum. Of the ones that *are* available, at least 75% of them just link you to the browser-based version of the app rather than a standalone app, and these rarely even work on amazon tablets (i.e. Discord, YouTube, etc).

Second, even the base-level functionality of the tablet is filled with glitches. You may not get a notification from any of your social media for months, then all of a sudden have 100+ notifications pop up at once at an indeterminate amount of time in the future. The software is also very laggy and I've had terrible connection issues that I'm certain aren't due to my internet provider (Google Fiber), and have troubleshooted otherwise.

Third, the tablet is riddled with ads. The entire lock screen is littered with so many that it is just plain obnoxious. Given the price, I could deal with this if the other issues weren't there, but as it stands it is unacceptable.

The only time I ever use this tablet is when I have literally no other devices to use at the time, and I still walk away frustrated from using it for as little as 30 minutes. I would not recommend it at all.

I have difficulty with my eyesight that made me decide to try digital reading and this kindle is, so far, the best model I have found, out of what is currently available for 2020. My eyes stutter along the words if they show up on a white page in black font. I found the setting, in the Fire Kindle HD, that allows you to have it in a Dark Mode where the backscreen is black and the text is white. This setting reduces my migraines and eye stutter so much that I went from refusing to read anything and almost despising books to reading every single day as well as writing my own novels!

Also, I really rely on the cover art as much as the book description when choosing my next read. If using an Oasis or any other Kindle model like it(Paperwhite), everything is black and white. This severely reduces certain details in artwork, sometimes part of the artwork disappears completely when converted to black and white. I know this is really sounding picky and bitchy but, having the artwork in color is so effective in grabbing my attention and pulling me in!

I also found this Kindle Fire HD8 to be quick, easy to use and worked well with the ""Alexa"" software compared to other, older, models I've had. I loved the huge library space and thin more ergonomic feel and weight of the device. I really recommend this model, it's eye opening! <see what I did there?

This won‚Äôt match the iPad on any high end tablet. Where it beats most tablets is the price. Even the cheap unknown Chinese tablets you find on amazon aren‚Äôt this cheap, and with equal or if not worse specs.

Who is it for? People who are into the amazon ecosystem. I have prime, I have echoes. This makes sense to me. It can play all video services like Netflix or Hulu so it‚Äôs not just limited to amazon stuff. Can it do google play store? With an extra step yes and it works great that way. Millions of tutorials how, just make sure you know exactly which versions to get.

Setup was insane if not scary. Out of the box and turning it on, it already got into my wifi and amazon account logged in and ready to go. I‚Äôm guessing since I have echo devices already in place, alexa took care of the rest. Very cool...outside of feeling a bit violated

What I like: USB-C charger. That‚Äôs the future. Adapt or die. Speakers are also surprisingly good given the price. It‚Äôs also small and thin. Perfect for travel.

What I don‚Äôt like: screen is not great. But for 50 bucks it is. You get what you pay for.

To my surprise, the same games were loading/running at the same speed as my ipad mini 2. I was hoping for a faster load time experience but no such luck. At least the games don't crash as often as the ipad. It could be the android vs ios platform as well. To give a perspective, iphone 11 loads the game in 12 seconds whereas this kindle fire 8 takes 26 seconds to load.

I also compared speed with the 2017 Fire HD 10"" and load times were about the same for the same apps.

PROS:
- low price - I didn't even buy a screen protector for the device
- Amazon apps run fine (kindle books, video, shopping)
- USB-C charging - finally don't have to look at the charging port to make sure to stick in the cable in the correct direction

The most conspicuous difference is that I no longer can zoom by spreading my fingers on the touch screen. This is a real setback. In some functions (including a game I play on the tablet) with fonts set at the maximum size, I can barely read the print. This was easily dealt with on the old tablet but I have to use a magnifying glass on the new one. This is, in my opinion, a serious defect.

The other complaint I have is button placement. It is too easy to accidentally turn this off because of the placement of the power button as well as an onscreen one. This is a minor inconvenience but one the user has to learn to work around.

Battery life seems to be much better and there is a noticeable improvement in sharpness of images onscreen. This is a very reasonably priced device.

After a great deal of research, I picked the Fire HD 8, and after a few days of using it, I couldn't be happier with my choice.

I purchased the version with lockscreen ads, but I honestly don't even notice them, and couldn't tell you anything about a single one that I've seen. All of the major streaming apps for movies, television, and music are available in the Amazon Appstore, and most were already pre-loaded on the device. The screen is great for this price range--colors are bright, lines are sharp, and there's not really any pixilation. The device is extremely lightweight, and fits nicely in my hands. It's made of plastic, but it doesn't feel cheap like many other devices in this price range. The sound quality is also surprisingly good, so it can easily be used without external speakers or earbuds without sacrificing too much in terms of quality. Battery life seems about average so far.

There are only a very small handful of negatives. The screen seems to hold fingerprints and smudges much more easily than many other devices that I own. Furthermore, the device as a whole seems sluggish for the first few minutes after turning it on, although this doesn't seem to last for very long. Additionally, while the Amazon Appstore has basically everything I want for my purposes, there's nowhere near the variety of the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, so some people will definitely be missing things they want. Semi-related to the lack of Appstore offerings, the Silk browser that comes preinstalled is honestly pretty terrible, and seems to even have trouble properly processing things in Bing, which is its default search engine; I plan to rarely use this to surf the web, and set up Bing Rewards so I at least get something out of it if I feel that I need to do so, so this isn't as problematic for me as it may be for others.

Overall, this is a fantastic tablet at this price point. If you primarily want to stream music and video, or are looking for something inexpensive for a child, this is a great option. Unlike the other offerings in this price range (Onn and random Chinese brands), the screen quality and sound are great, and this doesn't feel cheap (I'd imagine that it's sold at cost or at a loss, primarily to encourage people to utilize Amazon services). If the Amazon Appstore were more robust--which would be doing consumers a favor by hitting the current duopoly, considering Apple is trying to build a ""walled garden"" they control entirely, and Google would like to do something similar (especially when Fuchsia rolls out to phones and tablets in two or so years)--I would honestly recommend this device to everyone who was looking for a tablet. That being said, this is easily the best device in this price range, and anyone considering a tablet, especially if they're primarily looking for a streaming device, should give the Fire HD 8 a look.","06 24, 2021",R304DDBYFFX5ZQ,AJ13_91,"Fantastic tablet, especially for the price",1624464000

Knowing it's a kindle, expectations aren't high for tablet use and it's a good thing. It's slow as molasses when used as a tablet. I cannot stream on it without downloading first. Not a deal breaker. I only use it for streaming for my 4 year old on road trips. It's got plenty of memory to download several series for her, so all is good.
Even on my fiber internet at home It's buggy like every Kindle I have ever owned.

Durability? So far it's fine. Kindle aren't known for lasting real well and I expect this to be the same. I am mostly using it for reading in bed, so it's all good.

As a Kindle It's good. The actual display area goes far closer to the edge than the previous model. Very nice for reading.
Easy adjusting brightness, font size and background. Great for nights when I am blind as a bat and need to increase font size.

The location of the slide for book location is a bit of a pain when laying down reading. I am forever jumping all over the book just by holding with my left hand.
This version seems super laggy when scrolling to read. It OFTEN highlights instead if scrolling. That's probably the most annoying part of this model.

The kindle store functionality has gotten a lot worse. Idk if.thats a problem with the software on this Kindle or a change in the store. Much harder to find categories of Kindle unlimited books.

Just now it stopped mid video and the screen turned black. I am sure when I go back to it there will be nothing wrong but it is quite disappointing, after being a long time Fire user, to discover the Fire 8 is now half the machine it used to be.

The many downsides of this Kindle 8 far exceeds the minor irritation that Bluetooth earphones cause me. So, yesterday I was trying to read a Kindle text to speech book on my new Kindle. I would get it to start reading but if the Kindle is tilted slightly it tells you that it's repositioning the screen, which makes it stop reading so you have to start all over with trying to get it to read. I turned off the repositioning screen option. At some point I touched the screen and brought the book to chapter 49 when I was reading page 11. It took a while to figure out how to get back to the beginning. Then I was listening for few minutes and, poof, the book goes into lock screen. So I would have to start over. I find there is no way to turn off lock screen and the longest you can set it is 30 minutes. A lot can happen in that 30 minutes, such as my Kindle realized that it can't connect to WIFI. I'm in my car so no, it can't connect to WIFI but it likes to remind me every few minutes, which turns the reader off and I have to start over. But I was driving so I had to wait until I got home. My internet was down when I got home so my kindle couldn't connect to WIFI still. It had to remind me. I was going to listen to my story until I fell asleep so I turned the WIFI off in options and turned reader back on. 30 minutes later, poof, it went to lock screen. I was done. It's going back today.

I'd say the fire hd 8 is a bit heavier than I expected for such a small tablet, but still comfortable enough to hold for a long time. I didn't install the google playstore because some said it could slow down the tablet. FireOS and its store obviously are limited, but because this is still android, you can find apk for other apps on apkmirror and install on the fire hd. I did the same to install lithium and tachiyomi and it worked nicely. The tablet is fast enough I'd say! I watched several prime videos on it and 720p comes out very watchable. Reading manga on this tablet is also very good. Some people say 8"" is too small for comics. That's true because comics often have text printed very small. Manga on the other hand are fine.

So why do I return it? Because the screen is not crispy enough to read text! honestly, after reading books on it for an hour it hurts my eyes. This never happens with my Ipad or samsung tablets. I should have known better that with this resolution. I hate this fact so much because i bought this mainly for light reading before sleep.

I talked to customer service and finally got to a technician and we got dirty with details and it still hasn't been fixed. It's been 4 years and these all have the same operating system every fire tablets. So that means none of them work and I can't believe nobody has complained or mentioned this!! I am tired of doing their work for them and sitting on the phone and getting frustrated and messing with my emotions because of their lack of American love and to sell products that actually work as advertised!!!

I asked for them to send me a plus because that has a better processor and maybe that would have fixed the problem, but their option is telling me to return it and rebuy it when I got it on sale and it's like triple the price. So you want me to return the tablet that doesn't work that you false advertise me on in the reason why I bought it and you want me to return it so I can purchase another one that's not on sale that's three times the price just to see if that works properly? Ummm no!!! You just lost yourself a customer. I'm a genius and I love to fix things and I was trying to help you guys out and I wasted enough time with you. I'm appalled at your option for helping fix this issue that solely relies on your false advertisements... I would rather get a handy j from Freddy Krueger, then to ever ever ever ever waste my time with an Amazon product if this is how they stand behind them...
If you plan on using the Bluetooth 5.0 and LDAC, do not get this tablet. It doesn't do anything except videos. Everything else, it's not powerful enough to do. Not even barely surf the web. They could have only fixed this, this would be the number one tablet on the market simply for what it's actually for, to enjoy videos and quietly without disturbing people around you and without being disturbed yourself....
All fire HD tablets are a fail!!! I appreciate you guys wasting all of the time you have made me waste for absolutely nothing... I won't be giving you guys any more free education.... Please move on with this and go buy something else unless you just want it for video and external speakers, then this is your tablet.

34,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",5,"I traded in my 7th generation fire tablet for one of these because I was getting frustrated with the slow response, short battery life, and small storage (yes, I know you can use an SD card, but even that presents problems). I was pleasantly surprised to see that this one was noticeably better in all areas. The bigger screen makes it better for movies or web browsing, though not too big that it's cumbersome to handle. The battery lasts days now as opposed to minutes. It will even give you an estimate as to how much longer the battery will last on its current charge, or when plugged in, how long until fully charged. The processor is so much faster and the loading times for opening apps is significantly improved. It even has a game mode that will shut down all other apps to allow for more processing power to the game your playing. The bigger hard drive means there may not be a need for you to expand the storage, but I still use the SD card slot to transfer movies from my computer, so I'm glad it's still there.

If you're familiar with Amazon products (especially FireTV) you know that they are generally intended for people within the Amazon ecosystem (Amazon Prime and/or Amazon purchases). So when you scroll you ""Your movies,"" it's not going to be movies on your device, or even streaming services you subscribe to. It'll simply movies available on Amazon Prime, regardless of whether or not you subscribe. Same with music, books, etc. While it does make it feel like you're only using 2/3 of your device's full potential, it's not intrusive to the point that it becomes frustrating, and not to the point that I felt the need to remove a star.

Those purchasing this tablet should not compare it to tablets made by Apple or Samsung, and it is important to keep in mind that this is really a Fire OS device, not Android. Yes - Fire OS is based on Android; but not the same - a hack is required to run Android apps and even with that they are not guaranteed to run 100% effectively. In short, apps by Google are not available on this app, smart home apps (not designed to work with Alexa), password managers, and other apps will not be available on the Fire Tablet. Overall, this is the perfect app for content consumption - those just needing a browser, those looking to watch Prime videos/movies, content on Netflix or Disney+, etc‚Ä?There are gaming apps as well; but most are not graphic intense. I also question the build quality, thinking back at the Nexus tablets that were released years ago, it seems like Amazon could have built these a bit better for the cost. Personally, I feel as if Amazon should switch to Android tablets. I know that they want to keep people in their ecosystem; however, with not many making Android tablets, this would make them more appealing and useful to many more people.","06 29, 2021",R2THQQ83YY4TLA,iMe,Bargain Tablet That Works Well,1624896000

Turns out that tech support is a thing of the past. They dont even claim to be technical support but since they are employed by Amazon as customer service reps they should magically know how to fix glitches, right? Wrong. Ok tried a few suggestions with no improvement so requested a return and replacement. Was told there are no replacements as the 'company' making them isnt making them any more. Say what again? I have eyes to see they are for sale right here on my trusty Amazon website. Ok, whatever, lemme just return it. Ok fine you have authorization to return it. A few days later I find out that Amazon is charging me a 'restocking fee'. Say what? You're going to take this glitchy item and stuff it back on the shelf? Not good biz practice, Amazon.

This message pops up. At first, I don't recall the message pooping up and the screen designed just changed. I later realized that it did and I was just closing it. I also didn't really pay attention that it was telling me the screen was redesigned supposedly to make it easier on me, with just having the three headings or tabs. If you look at the pictures of the tablet advertised, it shows the old style, not the ""new and improved"" style.

I called Amazon support and they did an extensive troubleshooting session with me which included a hard boot. The screen would show up as the old way, but then at some point it would change to the ""new and improved"" appearance. I tried registering it many times and most of the time the screen would become the old style only to change to the "" new and improved"" style. Why would they do this? Anyway, I complained so they sent me a new tablet and said to just keep the first one. Well, I got the replacement and guess what? It does the same as the first one!

Why doesn't the developer of this particular tablet realize the error in programming the device? Why don't the people that creates the advertisement on the website know this feature put the picture of the ""new and improved"" screen on the website? Why isn't the people that troubleshoot these tablets aware of this? Why change the screen on the tablet? Who is ""we"" decided? Are they actual customers that have suggested a change is needed?

I've managed to keep one of the tablets on the original screen set up for now, but who knows when it will decide to change. Now I have two tablets! I guess since these are so cheap compared to the Samsung tablet and iPad, what can I expect. I wish I could afford a better quality tablet!

BTW, I started writing my review on the new tablet and attach the photos, but I got an error that they are trying to fix it. I had to use my old tablet to create this.

Overall, I think this is a great device with only one or two dings after getting used to the changes. I love the larger screen, increased sound quality with two speakers and the extra memory. And I'm still finding new helpful functions on the device.

Things I've adjusted to:
As for navigation, I now only have For You, Home and Library tabs instead of the Home, Books, Games,etc. I asked why in the beginning but now like having the one screen to see each category. On the flip side unless I'm missing something, instead of going to Books tab then having the Store option, I have to go to Library, Show More, Open Kindle then I'm at the Store button. A lot more steps.

The speakers are both on the left side of the device which really annoyed me at first. The sound quality is great but was out of balance when holding upright. Nice and loud for left ear but much quieter for right one. But I've adjusted to it so much that I don't really notice it anymore.

Still don't like:
The moving of the power button to the left side on top of the device putting it right next to the volume buttons. This might sound minor but I can't count the number of times that I've reached to change the volume and hit power button. They are that close especially when doing it by feel. To add to the issue, the up and down volume buttons are so close they feel like a single button.

So I've adjusted to all the changes and really appreciate the 8""HD except for that Power button location. Also I absolutely love the Alexa Device Dashboard icon on the bottom navigation bar.","01 23, 2021",R8FFFN2QZ7TZA,Kindle Customer,Overall a step up,1611331200

I bought a case for it, so it can stand on it's own, and I guess be somewhat protected in case it's dropped.

Upgraded my review to four stars. I was contacted by Amazon‚Äôs device support and they were awesome at helping me fix my issues. The first rep I spoke to was a woman who was super nice and personable. She was able to help me get my book to download properly. She wasn‚Äôt able to figure out the game download issue however, so she transferred me to another rep to help. That second rep was able to help me out within 10 minutes. Now, my fire HD8 downloads all my books and games properly. I still left off one star as my tablet can still be a little glitchy, and sometimes response lags a little when I click on links, but otherwise it‚Äôs back to working like new. Kudos to Amazon‚Äôs customer support!

I traded my older generation HD8 for this newer one, which I regret. At first, this newer HD8 worked beautifully and I was very happy with it. Within just a couple of months however it‚Äôs become very glitchy, especially when it comes to downloading new books and games to it. You can see in my attached pictures that the tablet stays stuck on ‚Äúdownloading‚Ä?without actually downloading anything at all. It‚Äôs been stuck ‚Äúpreparing to download‚Ä?the Fishdom game for over two weeks. Restarting, and turning off and back on multiple times have not helped at all. It‚Äôs been stuck like this for two weeks. It also repeatedly tells me I am not connected to the internet even when I very clearly am. All other connected devices in my household have no issue.

For the games and books that are already downloaded, it works fine. The screen quality is very nice. The battery life is great for a kindle fire. Those are about the only good things I can say about this tablet. Buy at your own risk. You may get lucky and get one that works like it‚Äôs supposed to, but I definitely didn‚Äôt.","12 12, 2020",RE6LTA6UWRBP4,Mel P. Mel P.,"Very glitchy, not very happy",1607702400

7,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",4,"-This is a review for the new Fire HD 8 tablet

My Experience: I actually bought this for a family member of mine and wasn't meant for me, however the family member in question gave me the tablet back and I saw that someone else's account was already preloaded onto this tablet along with my own account. The tablet had a passcode of some sort that I couldn't figure out and I couldn't understand it since the tablet's language setting was set to French. Thankfully one factory reset later and I was able to setup my account and was able to use the tablet however I'm docking 1 star because of that, I'm tech savvy but I'm sure the average customer would have just returned the tablet and left a 1 star review on the product.

The tablet itself is fine really, I got it on sale for around $54.99 before tax and it's a solid tablet for the kids if you want them distracted. There's type-c this time around which is a major improvement in my opinion and it's about time they made the switch. You can get the google playstore loaded onto this tablet, might have to do a bit of research on that but it is possible and definitely worth it but the gaming experience won't all be there, I tried playing one of my games called Monster Super League and it was not running so great and I had to turn on low quality graphics and it was still chugging a bit and switching between characters was really slow. My younger brother plays Roblox on it and he hasn't really complained thus far, so all depends on the game. This tablet however is not meant for gaming, it's meant for being a versatile E-reader that can also play YouTube videos and play some light games on the side and at this price point it's really hard to complain and I can easily give this tablet a recommendation, especially if you manage to catch it on sale.

Positive:
+ Type-C charging
+ Very inexpensive
+ Very nice size
+ Viewing angles aren't that bad

Neutral:
| Can load the google playstore, however tinkering will be required
| plastic build quality all around

Negative:
- Already had another person's account preloaded onto the tablet
- Had to factory reset it in order to access the tablet at all

Recommended: Definitely a strong recommendation if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet that you can just hand off to your kids or just want something to enjoy your e-books on","11 11, 2020",RU1AETQ8DAIW3,SenseiPichu SenseiPichu,"Came with another account already on board, decent tablet for the price",1605024000
8,B07TMJ1R3X,"[0, 0]",4,"I bought an Amazon Fire HDX 7 when it was first released nearly a decade ago. It was a stellar Kindle edition with a great screen, a comfortable feel and a burgeoning reputation as the best reading tablet on the market. Given that track history, I took a chance and upgraded to a Fire HD 8 in late January 2021. My buy-in wa predicated on the fact that Amazon would provide a $15 trade-in credit on my near-mint condition HDX 7. Long story short: Amazon rejected the HDX 7 trade-in and charged me the additional $15. Worse, they sent me an ad-supported HD 8 when I clearly had placed a slightly more expensive non-ad edition in my online cart. it subsequently cost me an additional $15 to cancel the ads showing up on the Fire HD 8 home screen.

As for the Fire HD 8 unit itself, there's not much to be overjoyed about. The software is fine but it's still Amazon-based and does not play well, if at all, with Mac or Android devices. The requisite Silk browser is several generations behind Google's Chrome or Apple's Safari. The screen is clear but, really, it looks and feels like a step backward from the HDX 7 screen. Also, the overall design of the unit in one's hands is a bit clunky. I have yet to sit and read with the unit held in my hands for any period longer than 10 minutes; invariably I need to prop it up on a pillow or set it against something.

In this owner's opinion, the Fire HD 8 is a Ford not a Mercedes.","02 15, 2021",R1T8AVRDTOXWNW,Randi,Fire HD 8 is solid Amazon product but a long way from a standout,1613318400

CONS: I discovered to my dismay that all images opened in the default photo app only shows the image at a preview resolution, no matter the image size (WHY???). So I used a separate app and that allowed me to at least zoom in and see a crisp image with a tiny 1.8MB file size, but it takes a while to update. I don't know at what exact file size the device will decide it's too much and cap your image resolution. I tried 10MB-300MB lossless photos I had made. But when I zoomed in and waited for the screen to update, it still showed a very pixilated image. It could still be a limitation of the various apps I tried, but I find it troubling that in 2020-2021 the 8"" Fire HD out-of-the-box makes me feel like tech is falling backwards and I'm stuck in the 90's, looking at pixilated image after image.

The cons I have experienced so far is that that i ended up paying $65 out the door- I know there is tax but I wish they would be upfront with the electronic waste fee (no big deal). Then I realized there are ads popping up on my wake screen, so after some research I found out that at some point I ""agreed"" to that for a $15 discount??? (on my invoice it says (-$35) deal of the day, nothing else. SO now if I want to get rid of them I have to pay $15...just cuz. So far I've only seen it on the wake screen, but read they can pop up other places. Lastly, it most definitely needs a case, and the case amazon made for it is $30- half of what I paid for the actual device- that just annoys me. My son has the previous model with the kids case and that has worked really well for him, except he recently dropped it just right and shattered his screen- so get a screen cover too if this is for a child, or you plan on carry it around with you a lot. I have had a couple glitches here and there but nothing that wasn't easily remedied.
Pros- the price is amazing , even if it is annoying to pay so much more for accessories. It does everything it should. I like that it has the goodreads app, because I was already using that to help me find books to read. I thought books would be cheaper in digital form, they are still a little more than I want to spend- but I am happy to support authors instead of buying used books. I bought this so I can let my 3 year old play academic games and watch you tube on occasion (when I have to do her hair, cut fingernails, etc.) instead of doing that on my Iphone where she has erased things. And so I can use the e-reader, and have a spare portable device. For that, it is perfect.

What I don't like is that pressing the screen doesn't wake it back up, I have to give a light press to the power button then swipe up to unlock from the ad page. I have Wyze cams and lots of Alexa devices but I wasn't able to view the Wyze cam on this so far. I don't even see a Wyze app in the app store, just generic IP camera apps.

I downloaded Netflix and it seems as if videos play well and are clear. I will update as time goes on and I get a better idea of its functionality, but so far it seems good for what I want it to do.

The Fire 7 was slow, sluggish, took what seemed like forever for apps to load/start. I had one streaming music app where I had to wait 5 minutes at times for the playlist to start playing. This thing? Instant. The way it should be.
The Fire 7 seemed to have wireless and bluetooth issues. Not this. But then, I'm starting to think there was just something wrong altogether with the Fire 7. It's now recently started freezing up and not running. And I've done factory resets on it several times to get it to work..
So, regardless of its issues.. this new Fire 8 is nice and fast and responsive. The wireless and bluetooth operate smoothly as they should. And I used the trade-in program using my older HDX 8.9.

27,B07TMJ1R3X,"[2, 2]",1,"I cannot stress enough how much I wouldn't recommend this purchase. It may seem appealing given the low price for a decent sized tablet, but it has a myriad of issues and works so poorly I get stressed out every time I use it.

First, there is nearly zero support for this tablet. Almost no standard apple/android apps are available, even ones that should be a bare-minimum. Of the ones that *are* available, at least 75% of them just link you to the browser-based version of the app rather than a standalone app, and these rarely even work on amazon tablets (i.e. Discord, YouTube, etc).

Second, even the base-level functionality of the tablet is filled with glitches. You may not get a notification from any of your social media for months, then all of a sudden have 100+ notifications pop up at once at an indeterminate amount of time in the future. The software is also very laggy and I've had terrible connection issues that I'm certain aren't due to my internet provider (Google Fiber), and have troubleshooted otherwise.

Third, the tablet is riddled with ads. The entire lock screen is littered with so many that it is just plain obnoxious. Given the price, I could deal with this if the other issues weren't there, but as it stands it is unacceptable.

The only time I ever use this tablet is when I have literally no other devices to use at the time, and I still walk away frustrated from using it for as little as 30 minutes. I would not recommend it at all.

EDIT: Forgot to mention one of the worst features. Even with the tablet at 100% battery before completely shutting it off for the night, it will still somehow be dead by the morning. Makes me wonder what kind of apps they are running in the background even with it shut off.","01 28, 2022",R185HY0DWZ3CPM,Cameron M Crane,"Terrible product, not even worth the low price",1643299200

I mainly use a tablet for reading and saving my Kindle books, web browsing, a game here or there, storing photos, and probably some other small things like small notes. I'm sure there are some things I haven't mentioned, but those are the basics. After about a year ago I noticed that I wasn't able to get any more OS updates. Without the latest OSX versions you aren't able to download apps like Netflix or YouTube (there are the other things I use a tablet for). Also, websites aren't maximized for an unsupported Safari browser. I looked at the Fire and Apple tablets. For what I use a tablet for the price of an iPad is crazy. For almost a fraction of the cost, it was a no-brainer.

The Fire HD 8 with screen-lock adds is great. I did go back and forth about if I was going to get the 8"" screen or the 7"" screen. I ended up going with the 8"". I made some changes to the main screen interface through the use of the ""Developer tools"", and added ""Google Play"". So, I get a little more true Android functionality out of it. So I still have all of the Amazon apps and I can add things that aren't offered through the AppStore. The screen size is great, I didn't want to carry around a 10"" tablet again.

With this point I honestly think I have a pretty good opinion on Kindles. I have difficulty with my eyesight that made me decide to try digital reading and this kindle is, so far, the best model I have found, out of what is currently available for 2020. My eyes stutter along the words if they show up on a white page in black font. I found the setting, in the Fire Kindle HD, that allows you to have it in a Dark Mode where the backscreen is black and the text is white. This setting reduces my migraines and eye stutter so much that I went from refusing to read anything and almost despising books to reading every single day as well as writing my own novels!

Also, I really rely on the cover art as much as the book description when choosing my next read. If using an Oasis or any other Kindle model like it(Paperwhite), everything is black and white. This severely reduces certain details in artwork, sometimes part of the artwork disappears completely when converted to black and white. I know this is really sounding picky and bitchy but, having the artwork in color is so effective in grabbing my attention and pulling me in!

I also found this Kindle Fire HD8 to be quick, easy to use and worked well with the ""Alexa"" software compared to other, older, models I've had.

Who is it for? People who are into the amazon ecosystem. I have prime, I have echoes. This makes sense to me. It can play all video services like Netflix or Hulu so it‚Äôs not just limited to amazon stuff. Can it do google play store? With an extra step yes and it works great that way.

Setup was insane if not scary. Out of the box and turning it on, it already got into my wifi and amazon account logged in and ready to go. I‚Äôm guessing since I have echo devices already in place, alexa took care of the rest. Very cool...outside of feeling a bit violated

To my surprise, the same games were loading/running at the same speed as my ipad mini 2. I was hoping for a faster load time experience but no such luck.
